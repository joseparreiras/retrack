Using detailed skill requirements from the near universe of online vacancies, we estimate technological change by occupation and find that technological change accounts for 45 percent of the decline in earnings after job loss. Technological change lowers earnings after job loss by requiring workers to have new skills to perform newly created jobs in their prior occupation. When workers lack the required skills, they move to occupations where their skills are still employable but are paid a lower wage.",

The model spans the full class of generalized extreme value import demand systems and implies that countries with relatively dissimilar technology gain more from trade. In the context of a multisector trade model, we provide a tractable and flexible estimation procedure for correlation based on compressing highly disaggregate sectoral data into a few latent factors related to technology classes. We estimate significant heterogeneity in correlation across sectors and countries, which leads to quantitative predictions that are significantly different from estimates of models assuming independent productivity across sectors or countries.",

The model features two types of pecuniary externalities: collateral externalities, because the resale price of capital affects collateral constraints, and distributive externalities, because buyers of old capital are more financially constrained than sellers, consistent with empirical evidence. We prove that the stationary equilibrium price of old capital is inefficiently high because the distributive externality exceeds the collateral externality, by a factor of two when we calibrate the model. New investment reduces the future price of old capital, providing a rationale for new-investment subsidies.",

A random assignment mechanism reveals that being assigned to the preferred environment is necessary for curbing or enabling self-serving behavior. Third parties can anticipate these effects, suggesting some sophistication about the cognitive constraints to belief distortion.",

The framework relies on regulatory variation in diversion caps to identify production functions for irrigated farms, then uses the estimated shadow values to assess the market's reallocation. I apply this framework to the largest water market in human history, located in southeastern Australia. Observed water trading increased output by 4\u20136 percent from 2007 to 2015, equivalent to avoiding an 8\u201312 percent uniform decline in water resources. Reallocation and average surplus both increase substantially during drought, implying that water markets can be most valuable when climatic variability is most severe.",

I develop an endogenous growth model where cross-country differences in R&D efficiency and cross-industry differences in innovation and adoption opportunities together determine equilibrium technology gaps, trade patterns, and income inequality. Countries with higher R&D efficiency are richer and have comparative advantage in more innovation-dependent industries. I calibrate R&D efficiency by country and innovation dependence by industry using R&D, patent, and bilateral trade data. Counterfactual analysis implies technology gaps account for one-quarter to one-third of nominal wage variation within the OECD.",

Targeted households received 46 percent more assistance in voucher areas. For the bottom 15 percent of households at baseline, poverty fell 20 percent. Voucher recipients received higher-quality rice, and increased consumption of eggs.

Using data of prescription opioid orders, we show that compared with chain pharmacies, independent pharmacies dispense 39.1 percent more opioids and 60.5 percent more OxyContin. After an independent pharmacy becomes a chain pharmacy, opioid dispensing decreases. Using the OxyContin reformulation, which reduced nonmedical demand but not the legitimate medical demand, we show that at least one-third of the difference in the amount of OxyContin dispensed can be attributed to nonmedical demand. We show that differences in competitive pressure and whether pharmacists own the pharmacy drive our estimates.",

We analyze Ukrainian trade transactions before and after the 2014 Russia-Ukraine conflict. In a difference-in-differences framework, we find that Ukrainian firms from districts with fewer ethnic Russians experienced a deeper decline in trade with Russia. This decline is economically significant, persistent, and can be explained by erosion of intergroup trust. Affected Ukrainian firms suffered a decrease in performance and diverted trade to other countries. Our results suggest that, through social effects, conflict can be economically damaging even away from combat areas.",

We use quantile regression to show that a significant portion of the convergence in Black-White exposure is attributable to differential impacts of the Clean Air Act (CAA) in Black and White communities. Areas with larger Black populations saw greater CAA-related declines in PM2.5. We show that the CAA can account for over 60 percent of the racial convergence in PM2.5 pollution exposure in the United States since 2000.",

Imperfectly observed offers must be rejected with positive probability, even when the players' preferences are common knowledge. Noisier observations imply a greater risk of rejection. In repeated ultimatum bargaining, the responding party can obtain a positive payoff if his signal of the opponent's offer is also observed by the opponent herself, but not if his signal is private. In alternating-offers bargaining, a player is better off when her own offers are observed more precisely and her opponent's offers are observed less precisely.

If investors hold heterogeneous beliefs unrelated to their fundamental trading motives and the planner calculates welfare using any single belief, a positive tax is optimal, regardless of the magnitude of fundamental trading. Under some conditions, the optimal tax is independent of the planner's belief. The optimal tax can be implemented by adjusting its value until total volume equals fundamental volume. Knowledge of (i) the share of nonfundamental trading volume and (ii) the semielasticity of trading volume to tax changes is sufficient to quantify the optimal tax.",

In contrast to equity dividends, total corporate payouts are highly volatile, turn negative when corporations raise capital, and are acyclical. At the same time, corporate asset returns are similar to returns on equity, and both are exposed to fluctuations in economic growth. To reconcile this evidence, we argue that acyclical but volatile net repurchases mask the exposure of total payouts' cash components to economic growth risks. We develop an asset pricing framework to quantitatively illustrate this economic channel.",

Using bond prices alone to estimate these kernels leads to currency puzzles: the inability of models to match violations of uncovered interest parity and the volatility of exchange rates. This happens because of the FX bond disconnect, the inability of bonds to span exchange rates. Incorporating innovations to the pricing kernel that affect exchange rates but not bonds helps resolve the puzzles. This approach also allows one to relate news about cross\u2010country differences between international yields to news about currency risk premiums.",

By delegating control to users, tokenization through utility tokens acts as a commitment device that prevents a platform from exploiting users. This commitment comes at the cost of not having an owner with an equity stake who, in conventional platforms, would subsidize participation to maximize the platform's network effect. This trade\u2010off makes utility tokens a more appealing funding scheme than equity for platforms with weak fundamentals. The conflict reappears when nonusers, such as token investors and validators, participate on the platform.",

The nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator for mixture models (Kiefer and Wolfowitz (1956)) is employed to construct optimal ranking and selection rules. Performance of the rules is evaluated in simulations and an application to ranking U.S. kidney dialysis centers.",

The staggered liberalization of access to foreign capital across disaggregated industries allows us to identify changes in firms' input wedges, overcoming major challenges in the measurement of the effects of changing misallocation. Liberalization increases capital overall. For domestic firms with initially high marginal revenue products of capital (MRPK), liberalization increases revenues by 23%, physical capital by 53%, wage bills by 28%, and reduces MRPK by 33% relative to low MRPK firms. The effects of liberalization are largest in areas with less developed local banking sectors, indicating that inefficiencies in that sector may cause misallocation. Finally, we propose an assumption under which a novel method exploiting natural experiments can be used to bound the effect of changes in misallocation on treated industries' aggregate productivity. These industries' Solow residual increases by 3\u201316%.",

The model allows for endogenous prices and instrumental variables, while avoiding parametric functional form assumptions about the unobserved components of utility. We use the approach to estimate bounds on the effects of changing premiums or subsidies on coverage choices, consumer surplus, and government spending on subsidies. We find that a $10 decrease in monthly premium subsidies would cause a decline of between 1.8% and 6.7% in the proportion of subsidized adults with coverage. The reduction in total annual consumer surplus would be between $62 and $74 million, while the savings in yearly subsidy outlays would be between $207 and $602 million. We estimate the demand impacts of linking subsidies to age, finding that shifting subsidies from older to younger buyers would increase average consumer surplus, with potentially large impacts on enrollment. We also estimate the consumer surplus impact of removing the highly\u2010subsidized plans in the Silver metal tier, where we find that a nonparametric model is consistent with a wide range of possibilities. We find that comparable mixed logit models tend to yield price sensitivity estimates toward the lower end of the nonparametric bounds, while producing consumer surplus impacts that can be both higher and lower than the nonparametric bounds depending on the specification of random coefficients.",

We highlight the role of two features of the expansion of Amazon's network: densification of the network of distribution facilities and vertical integration into package sortation. Densification results in a reduction in the cost of shipping orders, but comes at the expense of higher facility operating costs in more expensive areas and lower scale economies of processing shipments. Nexus laws furthermore generate additional sales tax liabilities as the network grows. Combining data on household spending across online and offline retailers with detailed data on Amazon's distribution network, we quantify these trade\u2010offs through a static model of demand and a dynamic model of investment. Our results suggest that Amazon's expansion led to significant shipping cost savings and facilitated the realization of aggregate economies of scale. We find that abolishing nexus tax laws in favor of a non\u2010discriminatory tax policy would induce the company to decentralize its network, lowering its shipping costs. Non\u2010discriminatory taxation would also entail lower revenue, however, as tax\u2010inclusive prices would rise, resulting in a fall in profit overall. This drop and the decline in consumer welfare from higher taxes together fall short of the increases in tax revenue and rival profit, suggesting that the abolishment of nexus laws would lead to an increase in total welfare.",

To this end, we introduce a new class of infinite population games, termed graphon games, in which a continuum of heterogeneous agents interact according to a graphon, and we show that equilibria of graphon games can be used to approximate equilibria of large network games sampled from the graphon. This suggests a new approach for design of interventions and parameter inference based on the limiting infinite population graphon game. We show that, under some regularity assumptions, such approach enables the design of asymptotically optimal interventions via the solution of an optimization problem with much lower dimension than the one based on the entire network structure. We illustrate our framework on a synthetic data set and show that the graphon intervention can be computed efficiently and based solely on aggregated relational data.",

First, using household data on the universe of consumer spending, I document that higher\u2010income households spend relatively more on labor\u2010intensive goods and services as a share of their total consumption. Interpreted as nonhomothetic preferences, this fact implies that economic growth increases the aggregate labor share through an income effect. Second, using disaggregated data on factor shares and capital intensities, I document that equipment\u2010intensive goods experienced relatively larger declines in their labor shares. Based on this finding, I estimate that capital and labor are gross substitutes, and that investment\u2010specific technical change reduces the labor share. Given the estimated elasticities, a parsimonious neoclassical model quantitatively matches the observed low\u2010frequency movements in the aggregate labor share since the 1950s, both its relative stability until about 1980 and its decline thereafter.",

In particular, we derive bounds on counterfactuals as the distribution of latent variables spans nonparametric neighborhoods of a given parametric specification while other \u201cstructural\u201d features of the model are maintained. Our approach recasts the infinite\u2010dimensional problem of optimizing the counterfactual with respect to the distribution of latent variables (subject to model constraints) as a finite\u2010dimensional convex program. We also develop an MPEC version of our method to further simplify computation in models with endogenous parameters (e.g., value functions) defined by equilibrium constraints. We propose plug\u2010in estimators of the bounds and two methods for inference. We also show that our bounds converge to the sharp nonparametric bounds on counterfactuals as the neighborhood size becomes large. To illustrate the broad applicability of our procedure, we present empirical applications to matching models with transferable utility and dynamic discrete choice models.",

As a first contribution, we obtain a novel geometric characterization of the null hypothesis in terms of identified parameters satisfying an infinite set of inequality restrictions. Using this characterization, we devise a test that requires solving only linear programs for its implementation, and thus remains computationally feasible in the high\u2010dimensional applications that motivate our analysis. The asymptotic size of the proposed test is shown to equal at most the nominal level uniformly over a large class of distributions that permits the number of linear equations to grow with the sample size.",

I develop a theory in which firms with displaceable labor are negatively exposed to such technology shocks. In the model, firms optimally adopt technology to gain competitive advantage but in equilibrium competition erodes profits and decreases firm value. Empirically, I find that firms with high share of displaceable labor have negative exposure to technology shocks. A long-short portfolio sorted on this variable mimics macroeconomic measures of technology shocks. Negatively exposed firms earn a 4% annual return premium consistent with displacement risk from technological progress.",

We argue this decline happened because book equity, BE, is no longer a good proxy for fundamental equity, FE, defined as the present value of cash flows under a common discount rate across firms. Specifically, we estimate FE for public US firms over time and find that the premium associated with the fundamental-to-market ratio, FE/ME, subsumes the BE/ME premium and has been relatively stable while the cross-sectional correlation between FE/ME and BE/ME decreased over time, inducing an apparent decline in the value premium. We also show that FE/ME captures the value premium better than several alternative value signals beyond BE/ME.",

We estimate the dynamics of price wedges for well-known anomaly portfolios and map them to firm-level mispricings. We find that several prominent anomalies like momentum and profitability further dislocate prices. Multi-factor models designed to eliminate one-month alphas still produce large price wedges. Our estimates yield a novel decomposition of Tobin\u2019s q, revealing that q\u2019s mispricing component has substantial explanatory power for firm investment. Overall, our results suggest that financial intermediaries chasing build-up anomalies negatively affect price efficiency and associated real capital allocation.",

These losses were larger for affected customers with fewer alternative suppliers. Internal liquidity buffers and increased borrowing, mainly through bank credit lines, helped firms navigate the shock. Nonetheless, the cyberattack led to persistent adjustments to the supply chain network, with affected customers terminating trading relations with directly hit firms and forming new ones with alternative suppliers with a stronger cybersecurity posture.",

We explain these findings using a model of the global trade network with market segmentation. Interdependent global production generates international comovements, while market segmentation disconnects the drivers of exchange rate correlations from the drivers of consumption correlations. Moreover, we show that the trade network generates common factors found in exchange rates. Our findings offer a trade-based account of the origins of international comovements and shed light on important frictions in international markets.",

We show that firms with outside CEOs achieve greater productivity improvements compared to firms with inside CEOs. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the relation is stronger in well-performing, rather than poorly performing, firms. Although part of the productivity growth differential comes from divesting low-performing, peripheral, low-tech, and unionized plants, most productivity improvements arise from streamlining continuing plants. Here, productivity is increased by consolidating products, changing the composition of investments toward newer capital, shifting to more capital-intensive production, adopting structured management practices, and improving labor productivity.",

The average postcrisis TFP growth of medium-sized, small, and micro firms was, respectively, 1.1, 2.9, and 5.4 percentage points lower than that of large firms. This SME productivity gap is larger for firms with more severe credit supply shocks. The gap is partially attributable to a larger postcrisis reduction in intangible capital at SMEs than at large firms. Horseraces suggest that SME indicators are more robust and more powerful predictors of postcrisis TFP growth than other indicators.",

We tabulate an aggregate wealth loss of $1.02 trillion to mutual fund investors over our 30-year sample, when opportunity costs are based on beta-adjusted SPY returns.",

We study a dynamic model in which borrowers must exert effort to maintain collateral quality and markets become illiquid when average quality is too low. Average quality grows quickly when it is high initially, but deteriorates or grows slowly otherwise. As such, even long-run market conditions are sensitive to a wide array of fundamental and non-fundamental shocks. Recoveries from illiquidity can occur, but only if funding is inefficiently rationed for some time. Policymakers without commitment may fall into intervention traps in which ex-post efficient liquidity injections cause permanent declines in collateral quality.",

Bondholders earn premia for two sources of systematic risk: exposure to low-frequency changes in the state of the economy, as captured by expected macroeconomic growth and volatility, and exposure to higher-frequency macroeconomic shocks. Our model predicts that the first source, labeled long-run macro risk, is the primary driver of the level and the cross-sectional variation in sovereign bond premia. We find support for this prediction using sovereign bond return data for 43 countries over the 1994\u20132018 period. A long-short portfolio based on long-run macro risk earns 8.11% per year in our sample.",

This negative correlation, which we term the U.S. dollar credit channel, is at least in part driven by institutional investors, who reduce their demand for risky loans on the secondary loan market when the dollar appreciates.

This paper departs from the parametric model, using a semiparametric formulation that reveals the explicit role that singularity of the long run conditional covariance matrix plays in determining multicointegration. The semiparametric framework has the advantage that short run dynamics do not need to be modeled and estimation by standard techniques such as fully modified least squares (FM-OLS) on the original I1 system is straightforward. The paper derives FM-OLS limit theory in the multicointegrated setting, showing how faster rates of convergence are achieved in the direction of singularity and that the limit distribution depends on the distribution of the conditional one-sided long run covariance estimator used in FM-OLS estimation. Wald tests of restrictions on the regression coefficients have nonstandard limit theory which depends on nuisance parameters in general. The usual tests are shown to be conservative when the restrictions are isolated to the directions of singularity and, under certain conditions, are invariant to singularity otherwise. Simulations show that approximations derived in the paper work well in finite samples. The findings are illustrated empirically in an analysis of fiscal sustainability of the US government over the post-war period.",

We also consider the case where the number of potential parameters/covariates is very large, i.e., increases rapidly with sample size, but the true model exhibits sparsity. We use a penalized sieve GMM approach to select the relevant variables, and establish the oracle property of our method in this case. We also provide new results for inference. We propose several new test statistics for the over-identification and establish their large sample properties.

Based on asymptotic expansions of the null and non-null distributions of the t-ratios derived under the many instruments asymptotics, we show that the second-order terms of those expansions may have non-trivial impacts on the size as well as the power properties. Furthermore, we propose adjusted t-ratios whose approximation errors for the null rejection probabilities are of order O(n\u22121) in contrast to the ones for the unadjusted t-ratios of order O(n\u22121/2), and show that these adjustments induce some desirable power properties in terms of the local maximinity. Although these results are derived under homoskedastic errors, we also establish a stochastic expansion for a heteroskedasticity robust t-ratio, and propose an analogous adjustment under slight deviations from homoskedasticity.",

This paper focuses on statistical inference for quantile regression in the \u201cincreasing dimension\u201d regime. We provide a comprehensive analysis of a convolution smoothed approach that achieves adequate approximation to computation and inference for quantile regression. This method, which we refer to as conquer, turns the non-differentiable check function into a twice-differentiable, convex and locally strongly convex surrogate, which admits fast and scalable gradient-based algorithms to perform optimization, and multiplier bootstrap for statistical inference. Theoretically, we establish explicit non-asymptotic bounds on estimation and Bahadur\u2013Kiefer linearization errors, from which we show that the asymptotic normality of the conquer estimator holds under a weaker requirement on dimensionality than needed for conventional quantile regression. The validity of multiplier bootstrap is also provided. Numerical studies confirm conquer as a practical and reliable approach to large-scale inference for quantile regression. Software implementing the methodology is available in the R package conquer.",

A two-stage method is introduced for estimating parameters in the fO\u2013U process based on discrete-sampled observations. In the first stage, H is estimated based on the ratio of two second-order differences of observations from different frequencies. In the second stage, with the estimated H, the other parameters of the model are estimated by the method of moments. All estimators have closed-form expressions and are easy to implement. A large sample theory of the proposed estimators is derived. Extensive simulations show that the proposed estimators and the large-sample theory perform well in finite samples. We apply the model and the method to the logarithmic daily RV series of various financial assets. Our empirical findings suggest that H is much smaller than 1/2, indicating that the RV series have rough sample paths, and that the mean reversion parameter takes a small positive number, indicating that the RV series are stationary but have slow mean reversion. The proposed model is compared with many alternative models, including the fractional Brownian motion, ARFIMA, and HAR, in forecasting RV and logarithmic RV.",

A semi-explicit hedging formula is derived for our general framework which applies to a myriad of the option pricing models proposed in the discrete-time literature. We conduct an extensive empirical study of the impact of modelling features on the hedging effectiveness of S&P 500 options. Overall, we find that fat tails can be credited for half of the hedging improvement observed, while a second volatility factor and a non-monotonic pricing kernel each contribute to a quarter of this improvement. Moreover, our study indicates that the added value of these features for hedging is different than for pricing. A robustness analysis shows that a similar conclusion can be reached when considering the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Finally, the use of a hedging-based loss function in the estimation process is investigated in an additional robustness test, and this choice has a rather marginal impact on hedging performance.",

In a local asymptotic framework, we show the validity of the bootstrap in estimating the variance of a combined forecast and the asymptotic covariance matrix of a combined parameter vector with fixed weights. Our proposed method preserves non-parametrically the cross-sectional dependence between different models and the time series dependence in the errors simultaneously.

The errors in the literature arise because random variability in the bias term has been neglected in earlier research. In stationary regression this random variability is of smaller order and can be ignored in asymptotic analysis but not without consequences for finite sample performance. Implications of the findings for rate efficient estimation are discussed.

I propose an alternative approach that allows for heteroskedasticity, achieving identification with a conditional mean restriction. These identification results apply to a latent Gaussian error term with flexibly parametrized heteroskedasticity.

As suggested by economic theories, the correlation structure among assets differs between emerging markets and developed countries. It is therefore imperative to make rigorous statistical inference on correlation matrix equality between the two groups of countries. However, if the traditional vector-valued approach is undertaken, such inference is either infeasible due to limited number of countries comparing to the relatively abundant assets, or invalid due to the violations of temporal independence assumption. This highlights the necessity of treating the observations as matrix-valued rather than vector-valued. With matrix-valued observations, our problem of interest can be formulated as statistical inference on covariance structures under sub-Gaussian distributions, i.e., testing non-correlation and correlation equality, as well as the corresponding support estimations. We develop procedures that are asymptotically optimal under some regularity conditions. Simulation results demonstrate the computational and statistical advantages of our procedures over certain existing state-of-the-art methods for both normal and non-normal distributions. Application of our procedures to stock market data reveals interesting patterns and validates several economic propositions via rigorous statistical testing.",

The key element in the minimax problem is that the worst case is over a class of distributions of the data which is invariant to a group of permutations. First, I show that given any assignment vector and any estimator, the uniform distribution over the same group of permutations, namely the complete randomization scheme, is minimax optimal. Second, under further assumptions on the class of distributions and the objective function, I show the minimax optimal estimation scheme involves completely randomizing an assignment vector, while the optimal estimator is the difference-in-means under complete invariance and a weighted average of within-block differences under a block structure, and the number of treated units is determined by the Neyman allocation.",

We then develop a full-commitment intertemporal collective household model, where the implied quantity demand equations are time-varying functions of a linear index. The fixed effects in this index equal logged resource shares, defined as the fractions of household expenditure enjoyed by each household member. Using Bangladeshi data, we show that women\u2019s resource shares decline with household budgets and that half of the variation in women\u2019s resource shares is due to unobserved household-level heterogeneity.",

The model naturally captures the phase transitions of the epidemic growth rate via change-points and further enjoys great interpretability due to its semiparametric nature. On the methodological front, we advance the nascent self-normalization (SN) technique (Shao, 2010) to testing and estimation of a single change-point in the linear trend of a nonstationary time series. We further combine the SN-based change-point test with the NOT algorithm (Baranowski et al., 2019) to achieve multiple change-point estimation. Using the proposed method, we analyze the trajectory of the cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths for 30 major countries and discover interesting patterns with potentially relevant implications for effectiveness of the pandemic responses by different countries. Furthermore, based on the change-point detection algorithm and a flexible extrapolation function, we design a simple two-stage forecasting scheme for COVID-19 and demonstrate its promising performance in predicting cumulative deaths in the U.S.",

We find that within-quarter nowcasts for the output gap are more reliable than for output growth, with monthly indicators for a credit risk spread, consumer sentiment, and the unemployment rate providing particularly useful new information about the final estimate of the output gap. An out-of-sample analysis of the COVID-19 crisis anticipates the exceptionally large negative output gap of \u22128.3% in 2020Q2 before the release of real GDP data for the quarter, with both conditional and scenario nowcasts tracking a dramatic decline in the output gap given the April data.",

The functional form for infections incorporates important features of epidemiological models but is flexibly parameterized to capture different trajectories of the pandemic. Daily deaths are modeled as a spike-and-slab regression on lagged cases. Our Bayesian estimation reveals that social distancing and testing have significant effects on the parameters. For example, a 10 percentage point increase in the positive test rate is associated with a 2 percentage point increase in the death rate among reported cases. The model forecasts perform well, even relative to models from epidemiology and statistics.",

This paper develops a procedure to estimate an individualized vaccine allocation policy under limited supply, exploiting social network data containing individual demographic characteristics and health status. We model the spillover effects of vaccination based on a Heterogeneous-Interacted-SIR network model and estimate an individualized vaccine allocation policy by maximizing an estimated social welfare (public health) criterion incorporating these spillovers. While this optimization problem is generally an NP-hard integer optimization problem, we show that the SIR structure leads to a submodular objective function, and provide a computationally attractive greedy algorithm for approximating a solution that has a theoretical performance guarantee. Moreover, we characterize a finite sample welfare regret bound and examine how its uniform convergence rate depends on the complexity and riskiness of the social network. In the simulation, we illustrate the importance of considering spillovers by comparing our method with targeting without network information.",

When commencing from an initial least squares estimate, the Newton step can also lead to weaker regularity conditions for a central limit theorem than some extant in the literature.

The proposed model is capable of capturing high-dimensional cross-sectional dependence and allows heterogeneous regression coefficients. For estimating model parameters, a new estimation procedure is proposed. When both the time and cross-sectional dimensions of the panel go to infinity, the uniform consistency and the asymptotic normality of the estimated parameters are established. In order to determine the dimension of the interactive fixed effects, we propose a new information criterion. It is shown that the criterion asymptotically selects the true dimension. Monte Carlo simulations document the satisfactory performance of the proposed method. Finally, the method is applied to study the quantile co-movement structure of the U.S. stock market by taking into account the input\u2013output linkages as firms are connected through the input\u2013output production network.",

Since there is no estimation framework for the spatial-lag model and the existing estimators for the spatial-error model are computationally demanding or have poor small sample properties, we suggest to estimate these models by the partial maximum likelihood estimator. We show that the estimator is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. To facilitate easy and precise estimation of the variance matrix, we propose the parametric bootstrap method. Simulations demonstrate the advantages of the estimators.",

Our main result is that the risk of a Eurozone breakup is significant although, quantitatively, it is not larger than in the period before the COVID-19 shock. In addition, we find that an increase in the redenomination risk in one country is associated with an increase in default premia and bond spreads in other Eurozone countries. Finally, we find that a sizeable fraction of the changes in the cost of insuring against redenomination and default reflects two additional factors: the first captures the insurance cost against a euro depreciation conditional on redenomination, while the second captures liquidity premia.",

During both the heightened market uncertainty and NYSE floor suspension periods, we find a significant increase in hidden liquidity yet significant decreases in both algorithmic trading and market fragmentation. However, despite withdrawing from the market during this period, remaining algorithmic traders appear to improve market quality.

We find that amidst the turmoil as market liquidity declined, ATs did not (disproportionately) withdraw liquidity supply. Stocks with the highest algorithmic trading (AT) experienced lower liquidity reduction compared to stocks with the lowest AT activity. High AT stocks did not experience greater reduction in either competition for liquidity provision or price improvements than low AT stocks. Multiple tests indicate that high AT did not associate with any greater deterioration in price efficiency vis-\u00e0-vis low AT stocks. Stocks in the industries hardest hit by COVID-19 did not see any less AT competition for liquidity supply or price efficiency than stocks in the least affected ones. Overall, our results allay some concerns that the current levels of AT make markets more susceptible to liquidity withdrawal in times of crises.",

We find that firms that had low credit scores in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, were more likely to apply for and receive the subsidies and concessional loans offered by the Japanese government in 2020, controlling for the sales growth after the onset of the pandemic. Firms with low credit scores are not necessarily zombies, which are defined to be the firms that are non-viable but kept alive by assistance from creditors and/or the government. Our result suggests that the government assistance may have subsidized some poorly performing firms that were not yet zombies before the pandemic.",

The data suggest that PPP abuse was relatively widespread as approximately 25% of firms receiving PPP loans indicated they would retain more jobs in their loan application than the number of employees they disclosed on their most recent regulatory filing (Form ADV). We show an existing model of investment advisor fraud predicts the most egregious PPP loans at a rate similar to actual cases of fraud. Investment advisors abusing the Program were significantly more likely to disclose a history of past fraud and other legal and/or regulatory misconduct. Using a conservative approach, we estimate that more than 6% of the $590 million in PPP funds received by SEC registered investment advisors consisted of overallocations to firms abusing the Program. We test a variety of hypotheses to shed further light on the nature of PPP abuse.",

This suggests that a firm\u2019s IR contributes to value generation by enhancing credibility with shareholders and by diversifying its shareholder base.

We quantify currency-induced balance sheet valuation effects for aggregate external positions as well as for broadly defined asset classes for the first quarter and the full year 2020. To do so, we use new data on the currency composition of cross-border assets and liabilities for 46 countries. In contrast with past financial crises, many emerging markets did not experience losses on their aggregate external balance sheets despite facing a domestic currency depreciation. This was partly due to currency-induced valuation gains on equity positions offsetting losses on debt positions, and partly due to reduced currency mismatch on their external debt positions. We conduct the stock-flow reconciliation of net international investment positions to measure overall valuation effects and compute the proportion that is due to changes in currency values. For about half of the countries in our sample, currency-induced valuation effects were substantial, representing over 50 percent of total valuation effects in 2020Q1 and the full year 2020.",

We find that increased infection rates affect firms more adversely as reflected by the wider increase in their credit default swap (CDS) spreads if they are larger, more leveraged, closer to default, have worse governance and more limited stakeholder engagement, and operate in more highly exposed industries. We observe that country-level determinants such as GDP, political stability, foreign direct investment, and commitment to crisis management (income support, health and lockdown policies) also affect the sensitivity of CDS spreads to COVID-19 infection rates. A negative amplification effect exists for firms with high default probability in countries with fiscal constraints. A direct comparison between global CDS and stock markets reveals that the CDS market prices in a distinct set of corporate traits and government policies in pandemic times.",

We find that growth dynamics remain a stable and sufficient predictor of credit risk incidence over the pandemic period, despite its large, short-lived swings due to government intervention and lockdown. Unobserved component models as used in the recent credit risk literature appear mainly helpful for explaining the high-default wave in the early 2000s, but less so for default prediction above and beyond growth dynamics during the 2008 financial crisis or the early 2020 covid default peak. Government support variables do not reduce the impact of either growth proxies or unobserved components. Correlations between government support and credit risk are different, however, during the financial and the covid crisis. Using the empirical models in this paper as credit risk management tools, we show that growth factors also suffice to predict credit risk quantiles out-of-sample during covid times.",

At the onset of the pandemic, short-selling activity shifted towards companies with low financial flexibility but only in countries with limited fiscal space. Among such companies, short sellers specifically targeted those that generate their revenues mainly in the domestic market. These short sellers entered their positions before the market crash, thereby generating significant abnormal returns. We find no evidence of either herding behavior prior to the market crash or a long-run performance reversal of short sellers. These findings support the notion that short sellers help to promote price efficiency in times of crisis, where governments with budgetary constraints are unable to provide sufficient stimuli to their economies.",

We document that dealers\u2019 internal risk limits came closer to binding during the March 2020 market turmoil. Although dealers eased their limits to accommodate increased liquidity demand, limit adjustments were not enough to offset the increase in risk exposures. We find limit tightness is negatively associated with subsequent inventory growth at dealers\u2019 bond trading desks, especially during the COVID-19 crisis or on days with limit changes. Overall, our results indicate the importance of internal risk limits in driving dealers\u2019 liquidity provision in time of stress.",

These results highlight how periods of crises \u2013 like the pandemic \u2013 affect the destabilizing influence of retail trading. To provide additional evidence, we replicate our empirical exercise during the 2008-09 financial crisis. Consistent with the COVID-19 period, we again find that retail trading leads to more volatility during the financial crisis vis-\u00e1-vis the pre-crisis period. These results again support the idea that periods of crises strengthen the link between retail trading and volatility.",

We analyse how bank stock returns during January\u2013March 2020 relate to the pre-crisis activation of macroprudential policy across 52 countries in a cross-sectional dimension. We find that, overall, a tighter macroprudential policy stance is beneficial for bank systemic risk, as assessed by equity market investors. A robust finding is that a perceived decrease in bank risk stems primarily from the use of credit growth limits, reserve requirements, and dynamic provisioning. By contrast, a pre-crisis build-up of capital surcharges on systemically important financial institutions seems to lower bank stock returns. Alternative bank risk indicators suggest that the latter is likely to be driven by concerns about profits rather than the probability of default.",

To begin with, we examine the extent to which state-level COVID developments influence yield spreads of municipal bonds. We find that macro-level factors are the primary determinants of municipal bond spreads during the pandemic, but state-level COVID developments also matter at the margin. For instance, a doubling of new COVID cases in a state is associated with a 2% (1.4 basis points) increase in yield spreads of municipal bonds issued in that state. Accordingly, lockdowns may decrease municipal bond spreads by reducing COVID cases, but lockdowns may also increase them by reducing local economic activities. Overall, we find that yield spreads in both primary and secondary municipal bond markets increase by about 15% following lockdown announcements, suggesting that lockdown announcements increase the risk premiums investors require for holding municipal bonds.",

Focussing on the 2016 UK referendum on EU membership, we find that the Risk-Neutral Distribution extracted from GBPUSD futures options whose expiry spans the referendum date becomes bimodal and the Implied Volatility curve exhibits an unusual W-shape. To the contrary, the corresponding effects for FTSE100 are found to be very limited. The large swings in expectations regarding the event outcome during the referendum night allow us to observe the counterfactual and validate the ex ante information revealed in the option market.",

We find that the coverage decisions of star analysts are better predictors of returns than those of non-star analysts. The return predictability of star analysts\u2019 coverage decisions is stronger for informationally opaque stocks. We further exploit the staggered short selling deregulations, Google\u2019s withdrawal, and the anti-corruption campaign as three quasi-natural experiments that create plausibly exogenous variations in the quality of information environment. These experiments show that the predictive power of star analysts\u2019 coverage decisions strengthens (weakens) following a sharp deterioration (improvement) in firms\u2019 information environment, consistent with the notion that star analysts possess superior ability to identify mispriced stocks. Overall, star analysts make better coverage decisions and play a superior role as information intermediaries, especially in poor information environment.",

Eigenvalue-based approaches, in contrast, provide a scenario-independent measure of systemic stability, but so far only handle a single contagion mechanism. We develop an eigenvalue-based approach that brings the best of both worlds, enabling the analysis of multiple interacting contagion channels without the need to impose a subjective stress scenario. Our model captures the solvency-liquidity nexus, which allows us to demonstrate that the instability due to interacting channels can far exceed that of the sum of the individual channels acting in isolation. The framework we develop is flexible and allows for calibration to the microstructure and contagion channels of real financial systems. Building on this framework, we derive an analytic stability criterion in the limit of a large number of institutions that gives the instability threshold as a function of the relative size and intensity of contagion channels. This analytical formula requires comparatively little data to elucidate the mechanisms that drive instability in real financial systems and thus complements the insights gained from traditional stress tests.",

Using daily yield curve data we estimate shadow rates for the US, Sweden, the euro area and the UK, and document that they fall (rise) as monetary policy becomes more expansionary (contractionary), following announcements of policy rate cuts (hikes), forward guidance, and balance sheet expansions (contractions). In addition, we show two applications for our shadow rate. First, we decompose shadow rate responses to monetary policy announcements into conventional and unconventional monetary policy surprises, and assess the pass-through of each type of policy to exchange rates. We find that exchange rates respond more to conventional than to unconventional monetary policy. Lastly, counterfactual experiments in two DSGE models suggest that inflation in the US and in Sweden would have been on average about 0.8 and 0.33 percentage points lower, respectively, had unconventional monetary policy not been used.",

Average call and put returns are negative at short maturities, more so for OTM options, and increase with maturity. Put returns are less negative than call returns, but this is not the case for delta-hedged returns, indicating that the aggregate risk of the underlying energy futures is priced in the raw option returns. Moneyness patterns in raw and delta-hedged returns are similar to patterns for index option returns. Significant differences between the four commodities remain after removing the effect of the underlying futures returns, with natural gas as the main outlier. Variance risk premiums are negative and explain some maturity patterns in returns, but they cannot account for return differences across markets. Energy producers are net short the underlying through their option positions, and speculators net long. The larger the net long position of the speculators, the lower the returns on call options, which suggests that demand from speculators may affect option returns in energy markets.",

Other things being equal, small banks are riskier than large banks since the latter are more likely to be bailed out. Thus, small banks face a higher cost of non-deposit financing and are unable to finance liquidity shocks at a cost below a certain threshold. Consequently, we show that under a tight monetary regime small bank lending is more sensitive to monetary shocks. This relation reverses under loose monetary regimes where large bank lending is more responsive to monetary shocks. Our empirical results strongly support our analysis.",

Employing a difference-in-differences specification we find that bank failures increased the GINI by 0.3 units (or 0.7%). We show that the rise in inequality is due to a decrease in the incomes of the poor that outpaces declines of the rest. We further show that individuals with lower levels of education exhibit a relatively greater decline in real wages and weekly hours worked. Exploring channels of transmission, we find income inequality is explained by a general decline in small business loans. This in turn reduces net new small business formation and their job creation capacity, a sector that hires a substantial share of low-income earners.",

The VRP proxy and GR are significant and complementary predictors for several horizons, including under one month (VRP proxy) and longer horizons (GR).

The absence of short sellers consequently results in less negative stock returns for politically connected firms as compared to their non\u2013connected peers. Our findings extend Boehmer et al.(2010) by showing that the absence of short sellers may not necessarily indicate good news but can be attributed to the presence of political connections. This study sheds some light on the sources of market value of political connections.",

Our results suggest that the effect of asset encumbrance on risk depends on the proportion of debtholders exerting market discipline and on the bank's liquidity buffers. We deal with concerns regarding omitted variables and reverse causality using several fixed effects estimations and an instrumental variables approach. Our findings can alert policymakers about potential side effects of policy interventions that can induce an increase of asset encumbrance in banks.",

We consider a sequential framework where two rollover games occur one after another.

We show that the presence of a large creditor with a sufficient asset size reduces the contagion effect. Moreover, a concentration of a large creditor\u2019s loan portfolio towards the former firm increases the contagion effect. (JEL G01, G33, D82, D83).",

We explore how state universal demand (UD) laws (which limit shareholder litigation as a mechanism to discipline managers), affect bank holding companies\u2019 (BHCs) risk. Using a difference-in-differences analysis, we show that BHCs reduce their tail risk exposures after the implementation of UD laws, which is achieved by improving loan asset quality. Indeed, BHCs appear to apply stricter contract terms for syndicate loans to risky and opaque borrowers. We also show that UD law implementation leads to changes in BHC board composition by increasing the proportion of outside directors, the number of independent directors in audit committees and the number of independent directors with financial expertise.",

Managing size strategies according to the two faces achieves significant performance improvements unexplained by common risk factors. Moreover, the two-faced size effect remains robust to stylized facts that invalidate the unconditional size effect. The conditional performance is consistent with the evidence that the prices of small stocks respond slowly to information shocks and is mainly driven by the conditional difference in cash-flow shocks between small and big stocks. Overall, our findings not only show that both small-minus-big and big-minus-small premiums exist but also highlight the necessity of accounting for these two faces when assessing the size effect.",

Accordingly, it is found that asymmetric information at the time of liquidation delays investment and reduces the amount of debt issuance. When the degree of asymmetric information is high, the firm cannot take a mixed financing consisting of risky debt and equity. The firm with collateral takes a mixed financing consisting of risk-free debt and equity, whose debt issuance amount equals the collateral value, whereas the firm without collateral takes all-equity financing. This result contrasts with that under symmetric information, where the firm always issues a mix of risky debt and equity. Moreover, when the degree of asymmetric information is substantial, an increase in cash inflow volatility decreases debt issuance. This result also contrasts with that under symmetric information, where an increase in volatility increases debt issuance.",

Firms with stronger controlling culture experienced fewer layoffs, less negative asset growth, greater debt issuance, and increased access to credit-line facilities during the crisis.

Our results suggest that analysts\u2019 forecast errors and dispersion increase with an increase in forex exposure within firms. These findings are robust to a wide range of robustness tests, including a quasi-experimental setting based on the sudden unpegging of the U.S. Dollar against the Chinese Yuan. Additional tests reveal that analysts spend more effort forecasting when firms experience an increase in forex exposure. Consistent with an increase in uncertainty of firm outcomes representing the primary channel through which forex exposure affects analysts\u2019 forecasts, we find that the effect of forex exposure is heightened in the presence of greater volatility in the U.S. Dollar. However, we also find that more readable annual reports and higher media coverage can help improve the quality of analysts\u2019 forecast properties for firms with increasing forex exposure. We also present evidence of some benefits analysts can realize from coverage of high forex exposure firms through generating greater stock trading and securing positions in more prestigious brokerage firms.",

I identify the relation using the vesting schedule of equity grants as an instrument for equity sales. This behavior is persistent across firm, executive, and governance characteristics. Both CFO and CEO vesting schedules impact repurchases, suggesting the CFO may also have influence over the execution of the repurchase program. There is minimal evidence of long-term value destruction. The results indicate executive contracts impact the execution of share repurchase programs.",

In particular, the estimated GARCH models yield a highly persistent volatility component, which allows the leverage effect to hold up until long horizons. Such a persistent volatility component is key to modeling long-term tail risk and pricing long-term put options. Overall, our exercise highlights the usefulness of volatility derivatives in GARCH option valuation.",

Using detailed skill requirements from the near universe of online vacancies, we estimate technological change by occupation and find that technological change accounts for 45 percent of the decline in earnings after job loss. Technological change lowers earnings after job loss by requiring workers to have new skills to perform newly created jobs in their prior occupation. When workers lack the required skills, they move to occupations where their skills are still employable but are paid a lower wage.",

The model spans the full class of generalized extreme value import demand systems and implies that countries with relatively dissimilar technology gain more from trade. In the context of a multisector trade model, we provide a tractable and flexible estimation procedure for correlation based on compressing highly disaggregate sectoral data into a few latent factors related to technology classes. We estimate significant heterogeneity in correlation across sectors and countries, which leads to quantitative predictions that are significantly different from estimates of models assuming independent productivity across sectors or countries.",

The model features two types of pecuniary externalities: collateral externalities, because the resale price of capital affects collateral constraints, and distributive externalities, because buyers of old capital are more financially constrained than sellers, consistent with empirical evidence. We prove that the stationary equilibrium price of old capital is inefficiently high because the distributive externality exceeds the collateral externality, by a factor of two when we calibrate the model. New investment reduces the future price of old capital, providing a rationale for new-investment subsidies.",

A random assignment mechanism reveals that being assigned to the preferred environment is necessary for curbing or enabling self-serving behavior. Third parties can anticipate these effects, suggesting some sophistication about the cognitive constraints to belief distortion.",

The framework relies on regulatory variation in diversion caps to identify production functions for irrigated farms, then uses the estimated shadow values to assess the market's reallocation. I apply this framework to the largest water market in human history, located in southeastern Australia. Observed water trading increased output by 4\u20136 percent from 2007 to 2015, equivalent to avoiding an 8\u201312 percent uniform decline in water resources. Reallocation and average surplus both increase substantially during drought, implying that water markets can be most valuable when climatic variability is most severe.",

I develop an endogenous growth model where cross-country differences in R&D efficiency and cross-industry differences in innovation and adoption opportunities together determine equilibrium technology gaps, trade patterns, and income inequality. Countries with higher R&D efficiency are richer and have comparative advantage in more innovation-dependent industries. I calibrate R&D efficiency by country and innovation dependence by industry using R&D, patent, and bilateral trade data. Counterfactual analysis implies technology gaps account for one-quarter to one-third of nominal wage variation within the OECD.",

Targeted households received 46 percent more assistance in voucher areas. For the bottom 15 percent of households at baseline, poverty fell 20 percent. Voucher recipients received higher-quality rice, and increased consumption of eggs.

Using data of prescription opioid orders, we show that compared with chain pharmacies, independent pharmacies dispense 39.1 percent more opioids and 60.5 percent more OxyContin. After an independent pharmacy becomes a chain pharmacy, opioid dispensing decreases. Using the OxyContin reformulation, which reduced nonmedical demand but not the legitimate medical demand, we show that at least one-third of the difference in the amount of OxyContin dispensed can be attributed to nonmedical demand. We show that differences in competitive pressure and whether pharmacists own the pharmacy drive our estimates.",

We analyze Ukrainian trade transactions before and after the 2014 Russia-Ukraine conflict. In a difference-in-differences framework, we find that Ukrainian firms from districts with fewer ethnic Russians experienced a deeper decline in trade with Russia. This decline is economically significant, persistent, and can be explained by erosion of intergroup trust. Affected Ukrainian firms suffered a decrease in performance and diverted trade to other countries. Our results suggest that, through social effects, conflict can be economically damaging even away from combat areas.",

We use quantile regression to show that a significant portion of the convergence in Black-White exposure is attributable to differential impacts of the Clean Air Act (CAA) in Black and White communities. Areas with larger Black populations saw greater CAA-related declines in PM2.5. We show that the CAA can account for over 60 percent of the racial convergence in PM2.5 pollution exposure in the United States since 2000.",

Imperfectly observed offers must be rejected with positive probability, even when the players' preferences are common knowledge. Noisier observations imply a greater risk of rejection. In repeated ultimatum bargaining, the responding party can obtain a positive payoff if his signal of the opponent's offer is also observed by the opponent herself, but not if his signal is private. In alternating-offers bargaining, a player is better off when her own offers are observed more precisely and her opponent's offers are observed less precisely.

If investors hold heterogeneous beliefs unrelated to their fundamental trading motives and the planner calculates welfare using any single belief, a positive tax is optimal, regardless of the magnitude of fundamental trading. Under some conditions, the optimal tax is independent of the planner's belief. The optimal tax can be implemented by adjusting its value until total volume equals fundamental volume. Knowledge of (i) the share of nonfundamental trading volume and (ii) the semielasticity of trading volume to tax changes is sufficient to quantify the optimal tax.",

In contrast to equity dividends, total corporate payouts are highly volatile, turn negative when corporations raise capital, and are acyclical. At the same time, corporate asset returns are similar to returns on equity, and both are exposed to fluctuations in economic growth. To reconcile this evidence, we argue that acyclical but volatile net repurchases mask the exposure of total payouts' cash components to economic growth risks. We develop an asset pricing framework to quantitatively illustrate this economic channel.",

Using bond prices alone to estimate these kernels leads to currency puzzles: the inability of models to match violations of uncovered interest parity and the volatility of exchange rates. This happens because of the FX bond disconnect, the inability of bonds to span exchange rates. Incorporating innovations to the pricing kernel that affect exchange rates but not bonds helps resolve the puzzles. This approach also allows one to relate news about cross\u2010country differences between international yields to news about currency risk premiums.",

By delegating control to users, tokenization through utility tokens acts as a commitment device that prevents a platform from exploiting users. This commitment comes at the cost of not having an owner with an equity stake who, in conventional platforms, would subsidize participation to maximize the platform's network effect. This trade\u2010off makes utility tokens a more appealing funding scheme than equity for platforms with weak fundamentals. The conflict reappears when nonusers, such as token investors and validators, participate on the platform.",

The nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator for mixture models (Kiefer and Wolfowitz (1956)) is employed to construct optimal ranking and selection rules. Performance of the rules is evaluated in simulations and an application to ranking U.S. kidney dialysis centers.",

The staggered liberalization of access to foreign capital across disaggregated industries allows us to identify changes in firms' input wedges, overcoming major challenges in the measurement of the effects of changing misallocation. Liberalization increases capital overall. For domestic firms with initially high marginal revenue products of capital (MRPK), liberalization increases revenues by 23%, physical capital by 53%, wage bills by 28%, and reduces MRPK by 33% relative to low MRPK firms. The effects of liberalization are largest in areas with less developed local banking sectors, indicating that inefficiencies in that sector may cause misallocation. Finally, we propose an assumption under which a novel method exploiting natural experiments can be used to bound the effect of changes in misallocation on treated industries' aggregate productivity. These industries' Solow residual increases by 3\u201316%.",

The model allows for endogenous prices and instrumental variables, while avoiding parametric functional form assumptions about the unobserved components of utility. We use the approach to estimate bounds on the effects of changing premiums or subsidies on coverage choices, consumer surplus, and government spending on subsidies. We find that a $10 decrease in monthly premium subsidies would cause a decline of between 1.8% and 6.7% in the proportion of subsidized adults with coverage. The reduction in total annual consumer surplus would be between $62 and $74 million, while the savings in yearly subsidy outlays would be between $207 and $602 million. We estimate the demand impacts of linking subsidies to age, finding that shifting subsidies from older to younger buyers would increase average consumer surplus, with potentially large impacts on enrollment. We also estimate the consumer surplus impact of removing the highly\u2010subsidized plans in the Silver metal tier, where we find that a nonparametric model is consistent with a wide range of possibilities. We find that comparable mixed logit models tend to yield price sensitivity estimates toward the lower end of the nonparametric bounds, while producing consumer surplus impacts that can be both higher and lower than the nonparametric bounds depending on the specification of random coefficients.",

We highlight the role of two features of the expansion of Amazon's network: densification of the network of distribution facilities and vertical integration into package sortation. Densification results in a reduction in the cost of shipping orders, but comes at the expense of higher facility operating costs in more expensive areas and lower scale economies of processing shipments. Nexus laws furthermore generate additional sales tax liabilities as the network grows. Combining data on household spending across online and offline retailers with detailed data on Amazon's distribution network, we quantify these trade\u2010offs through a static model of demand and a dynamic model of investment. Our results suggest that Amazon's expansion led to significant shipping cost savings and facilitated the realization of aggregate economies of scale. We find that abolishing nexus tax laws in favor of a non\u2010discriminatory tax policy would induce the company to decentralize its network, lowering its shipping costs. Non\u2010discriminatory taxation would also entail lower revenue, however, as tax\u2010inclusive prices would rise, resulting in a fall in profit overall. This drop and the decline in consumer welfare from higher taxes together fall short of the increases in tax revenue and rival profit, suggesting that the abolishment of nexus laws would lead to an increase in total welfare.",

To this end, we introduce a new class of infinite population games, termed graphon games, in which a continuum of heterogeneous agents interact according to a graphon, and we show that equilibria of graphon games can be used to approximate equilibria of large network games sampled from the graphon. This suggests a new approach for design of interventions and parameter inference based on the limiting infinite population graphon game. We show that, under some regularity assumptions, such approach enables the design of asymptotically optimal interventions via the solution of an optimization problem with much lower dimension than the one based on the entire network structure. We illustrate our framework on a synthetic data set and show that the graphon intervention can be computed efficiently and based solely on aggregated relational data.",

First, using household data on the universe of consumer spending, I document that higher\u2010income households spend relatively more on labor\u2010intensive goods and services as a share of their total consumption. Interpreted as nonhomothetic preferences, this fact implies that economic growth increases the aggregate labor share through an income effect. Second, using disaggregated data on factor shares and capital intensities, I document that equipment\u2010intensive goods experienced relatively larger declines in their labor shares. Based on this finding, I estimate that capital and labor are gross substitutes, and that investment\u2010specific technical change reduces the labor share. Given the estimated elasticities, a parsimonious neoclassical model quantitatively matches the observed low\u2010frequency movements in the aggregate labor share since the 1950s, both its relative stability until about 1980 and its decline thereafter.",

In particular, we derive bounds on counterfactuals as the distribution of latent variables spans nonparametric neighborhoods of a given parametric specification while other \u201cstructural\u201d features of the model are maintained. Our approach recasts the infinite\u2010dimensional problem of optimizing the counterfactual with respect to the distribution of latent variables (subject to model constraints) as a finite\u2010dimensional convex program. We also develop an MPEC version of our method to further simplify computation in models with endogenous parameters (e.g., value functions) defined by equilibrium constraints. We propose plug\u2010in estimators of the bounds and two methods for inference. We also show that our bounds converge to the sharp nonparametric bounds on counterfactuals as the neighborhood size becomes large. To illustrate the broad applicability of our procedure, we present empirical applications to matching models with transferable utility and dynamic discrete choice models.",

As a first contribution, we obtain a novel geometric characterization of the null hypothesis in terms of identified parameters satisfying an infinite set of inequality restrictions. Using this characterization, we devise a test that requires solving only linear programs for its implementation, and thus remains computationally feasible in the high\u2010dimensional applications that motivate our analysis. The asymptotic size of the proposed test is shown to equal at most the nominal level uniformly over a large class of distributions that permits the number of linear equations to grow with the sample size.",

Such aggregation yields a beneficial informativeness effect for incentivizing the global player. It however also induces harmful free-riding by local, market-specific players.

We find that industrialization occurred in areas that began with low wages but high mechanical skills, whereas other variables, such as literacy, banks, and proximity to coal, have little explanatory power. Against the view that living standards were stagnant during the Industrial Revolution, we find that real wages rose sharply in the industrializing north and declined in the previously prosperous south.",

In the unique symmetric equilibrium of this game, the countervailing incentives of attraction and persuasion yield a payoff function for each firm that is linear in the firm\u2019s realized effective value. If the expected quality of the products is sufficiently high (or competition is sufficiently fierce), this corresponds to full information: firms provide the first-best level of information. If not, this corresponds to information dispersion: firms randomize over signals.",

I develop a theory in which firms with displaceable labor are negatively exposed to such technology shocks. In the model, firms optimally adopt technology to gain competitive advantage but in equilibrium competition erodes profits and decreases firm value. Empirically, I find that firms with high share of displaceable labor have negative exposure to technology shocks. A long-short portfolio sorted on this variable mimics macroeconomic measures of technology shocks. Negatively exposed firms earn a 4% annual return premium consistent with displacement risk from technological progress.",

Consequently, forgiveness would benefit the top decile as much as the bottom three deciles combined. Enrolling households who would benefit from income-driven repayment is less expensive and distributes more funds to lower-income households.",

Heterogeneous opportunity costs rationalize routing choices: non-routable orders entail lower non-execution costs than routable orders. Our results indicate that fees and clientele segmentation drive the proliferation of order types in the Reg NMS era.",

Empirically, we estimate linear subspaces of SDFs compatible with popular extensions of the traditional and consumption versions of the CAPM, which are typically two-dimensional.

We characterize a rich structure of asset price comovement within and across benchmarks by analyzing shock elasticities and cross-elasticities of price-dividend ratios. Evidence on the heterogeneity of mutual fund mandates and the benchmarking-induced return comovement across cap-style and industry-sector portfolios corroborates the model assumptions and predictions.",

Specifically, we estimate FE for public US firms over time and find that the premium associated with the fundamental-to-market ratio, FE/ME, subsumes the BE/ME premium and has been relatively stable while the cross-sectional correlation between FE/ME and BE/ME decreased over time, inducing an apparent decline in the value premium.

Our estimates yield a novel decomposition of Tobin\u2019s q, revealing that q\u2019s mispricing component has substantial explanatory power for firm investment.

We explain these findings using a model of the global trade network with market segmentation. Interdependent global production generates international comovements, while market segmentation disconnects the drivers of exchange rate correlations from the drivers of consumption correlations. Moreover, we show that the trade network generates common factors found in exchange rates. Our findings offer a trade-based account of the origins of international comovements and shed light on important frictions in international markets.",

We show that firms with outside CEOs achieve greater productivity improvements compared to firms with inside CEOs. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the relation is stronger in well-performing, rather than poorly performing, firms. Although part of the productivity growth differential comes from divesting low-performing, peripheral, low-tech, and unionized plants, most productivity improvements arise from streamlining continuing plants. Here, productivity is increased by consolidating products, changing the composition of investments toward newer capital, shifting to more capital-intensive production, adopting structured management practices, and improving labor productivity.",

The average postcrisis TFP growth of medium-sized, small, and micro firms was, respectively, 1.1, 2.9, and 5.4 percentage points lower than that of large firms. This SME productivity gap is larger for firms with more severe credit supply shocks. The gap is partially attributable to a larger postcrisis reduction in intangible capital at SMEs than at large firms. Horseraces suggest that SME indicators are more robust and more powerful predictors of postcrisis TFP growth than other indicators.",

We explore mechanisms through which specialized M&A staff improve acquisition performance and investigate why only less than half of US firms employ such staff.

We study a dynamic model in which borrowers must exert effort to maintain collateral quality and markets become illiquid when average quality is too low. Average quality grows quickly when it is high initially, but deteriorates or grows slowly otherwise. As such, even long-run market conditions are sensitive to a wide array of fundamental and non-fundamental shocks. Recoveries from illiquidity can occur, but only if funding is inefficiently rationed for some time. Policymakers without commitment may fall into intervention traps in which ex-post efficient liquidity injections cause permanent declines in collateral quality.",

Our model predicts that the first source, labeled long-run macro risk, is the primary driver of the level and the cross-sectional variation in sovereign bond premia. We find support for this prediction using sovereign bond return data for 43 countries over the 1994\u20132018 period.

Simulations verify the statistical performance of a simple but novel estimator and of a test to detect global COVOL.

This paper assesses the impact of these changes on aggregate growth and welfare. We begin by inspecting a simple statistical decomposition of aggregate earnings growth using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics for the period 1967\u20132018. The decomposition expresses aggregate earnings growth as the sum of two terms. The first is the covariance between the level and growth of household earnings, which depends only on micro earnings dynamics. The second is the average growth across households, which depends on both micro and macro factors, such as a common labor productivity growth. In order to identify the impact of the changes in the micro dynamics on aggregate outcomes, we map a simple model of micro-founded growth onto the terms of the decomposition. We find that changes in households\u2019 earnings dynamics that are consistent with the micro data imply unequal growth across the earnings distribution that is, a transition period during which there is a change in the shape of the distribution of incomes that is not mean preserving, so that aggregate growth is affected. This change yields a positive effect on aggregate growth and, with incomplete markets, an ex-ante negative welfare effect.",

Through an ingenious decomposition, Lippi and Perri cast this relationship as a function of simple moments of the distribution of changes in household income. Their study delivers new evidence linking heterogeneous micro-level income changes to macro-level growth outcomes. Faster income growth among rich households has mitigated the slowdown of aggregate growth in the US, especially after 2000.

We do so by building the first Distributional Wealth Accounts for Europe, including households\u2019 assets, liabilities, investment flows, and the wealth distribution for most European countries from 1970\u20132020. We find that although aggregate household wealth to income ratios have followed a similar increasing pattern in both Europe and the United States since 1970, wealth concentration has increased much faster in the United States. Using wealth accumulation decompositions and counterfactual simulations, we show that the weaker rise in labor income inequality and the stronger rise in house prices relative to financial assets in Europe versus the United States appear to explain why Europe has experienced a more moderate rise in wealth concentration since the mid-1980s.",

We conduct a series of counterfactual experiments that illustrate the quantitative importance of both trade imbalances and capital-skill complementarity for the dynamics of the skill premium. We show that modeling trade imbalances can lead to stark differences between short- and long-run consequences of globalization shocks for the skill premium.",

Advanced economies reach their investment peak at a higher level of income and at an earlier point in time relative to emerging markets. We also observe the familiar patterns of structural change (a decline in the agricultural share and an increase in the services share, both relative to manufacturing). The pace of change observed in the 1930 to 1980 period in advanced economies is remarkably similar to that in emerging markets since 1960. Motivated by these facts, we develop a two-region model of the world economy that captures the dynamics of investment and structural change. The regions are isolated from each other up to the point of capital market liberalization in the early 1990s. At that point, capital flows from advanced economies to emerging markets and accelerates the process of structural change in emerging markets. Both regions gain from the liberalization of financial markets, but the majority of the gains accrue to the emerging economies. The overall magnitude of gains depends on the date of liberalization, the relative sizes of the two regions and the degree of asymmetry between the two regions at the point of liberalization. Finally, we consider the impact of a \u201csecond wave\u201d of liberalization when China fully opens its economy to capital inflows.",

Given realistic increases in wealth (inclusive of income) inequality, the calibrated model generates transition dynamics featuring productivity slowdowns, low aggregate demand, and low real interest rates, consistent with the empirical trends. The welfare cost of rising inequality is substantial and is nearly equally split between changes in the consumption distribution and slow growth.",

We observe that, during this time, there has been a remarkable increase in the use of sanctions as an instrument of foreign policy. We classify this period into four 'eras' and discuss, in this context, how the evolution of sanctions may be linked to salient features of the contemporaneous international political and economic orders. Our review of the related literatures in economics and political science suggests, among other things, that our understanding of sanction processes could be significantly advanced by marrying these perspectives. We conclude by identifying several questions and challenges, and by discussing how interdisciplinary research could address them.",

The use of sanctions, especially financial, has increased over the last 70 years. Financial sanctions have been particularly important whenever the goals of the sanctioning countries were related to democracy and human rights. Financial sanctions restrict entities\u2014countries, businesses, or even individuals\u2014from purchasing or selling financial assets, or from accessing custodial or other financial services. They can be imposed on a sanctioned entity's ability to access the infrastructures that are in place to execute international payments, irrespective of whether such payments underpin financial or real activity. This article explains how financial sanctions can be designed to limit access to the international payment system and, in particular, the SWIFT network, and provides some recent examples.",

Research has also shown that when risk premiums are compressed, there is an increased likelihood of a reversal that damages the credit-supply mechanism and the real economy. Together these effects create an intertemporal tradeoff for monetary policy, as stimulating the economy today can sow the seeds of a future downturn that might be difficult to offset. We draw out some implications of this tradeoff for the conduct of monetary policy.",

This article provides new evidence for this so-called risk-taking channel of monetary policy by revisiting and extending event-study analysis of Federal Open Market Committee announcements. We document significant effects of unexpected monetary policy changes on risk indicators drawn from equity, fixed-income, credit, and foreign exchange markets. We develop a new index of risk appetite based on the common component of these indicators. Surprise monetary easing leads to strong and persistent increases in our index, and vice versa for tightening surprises, consistent with the view that monetary policy affects asset prices in large part through its effects on risk appetite. We discuss the implications of the risk-taking channel for monetary policy transmission, optimal monetary policy, and financial stability.",

This paper studies the eleven episodes of monetary policy tightening by the Fed since 1965, and concludes that the central bank has a better record than that\u2014that as long as the criteria for softness are not too stringent, and Fed was actually trying to land the economy softly, the Fed has succeeded several times.

While different households respond to changes in monetary policy for different reasons, we argue that the overall consumption effects are relatively evenly distributed across households. Second, does household heterogeneity change our understanding of monetary policy transmission? A more careful account of microeconomic consumption behavior materially alters our understanding of transmission channels, but has rather limited effect on our general view of the aggregate effects of monetary policy. Third, does inequality affect the optimal conduct of monetary policy? Since monetary policy is a rather blunt distributional tool, we argue that even a central bank with an explicit distributional mandate would not deviate much from conventional policy prescriptions.",

Hispanics appear to have equal or even better health outcomes relative to non-Hispanic Whites across various health measures. This is known as the Hispanic health paradox. This paper underscores the importance of disaggregating Hispanics by ancestry and age profile when discussing the paradox across key health outcomes. It also provides an overview of the leading explanations, such as the salmon bias and the healthy immigrant effect. Further, it highlights the role of healthcare access and usage in this discussion. Ignoring these sources of bias have important consequences for how morbidity and mortality among Hispanics are measured within widely used national datasets.",

After discussing critical issues that arise in the US data sources commonly used to study Hispanics, we document how Hispanics currently compare with other Americans in terms of education, earnings, and labor supply, and then we discuss long-term trends in these outcomes. Relative to non-Hispanic Whites, US-born Hispanics from most national origin groups possess sizeable deficits in earnings, which in large part reflect corresponding educational deficits. Over time, rates of high school completion by US-born Hispanics have almost converged to those of non-Hispanic Whites, but the large Hispanic deficits in college completion have instead widened. Finally, from the perspective of immigrant generations, Hispanics experience substantial improvements in education and earnings between first-generation immigrants and the second-generation consisting of the US-born children of immigrants. Continued progress beyond the second generation is obscured by measurement issues arising from high rates of Hispanic intermarriage and the fact that later-generation descendants of Hispanic immigrants often do not self-identify as Hispanic when they come from families with mixed ethnic origins.",

We use bunching techniques to study an English policy that imposed strong incentives to treat patients within four hours. The policy reduced time spent in the ED by 21 minutes for affected patients yet caused doctors to increase treatment intensity and admit more patients. We find a striking 14% reduction in mortality. Analysis of patient severity and hospital crowding strongly suggests it is the wait time reduction that saves lives. We conclude that, despite distorting medical decisions, constraining ED doctors can induce cost-effective reductions in mortality.",

These politicians have direct influence over mining operations but no access to fiscal windfalls from mining; we thus isolate the direct political impacts of mining sector operations.",

An information treatment leads to a convergence in beliefs about racial discrimination but does not lead to a similar convergence in support of pro-black policies. The results demonstrate that while providing information can substantially reduce disagreement about the extent of racial discrimination, it is not sufficient to reduce disagreement about pro-black policies.",

Using a novel strategy, I find a narrow time window when most individuals attend church. Based on a panel between 1980 and 2016, I find that one more Sunday with precipitation at the time of church increases yearly drug-related, alcohol-related, and white-collar crimes. I do not find an effect for violent or property crimes. These effects are driven by more religious counties. Previous evidence showing negative effects of church attendance on the demand for alcohol and drugs is consistent with a demand-driven interpretation of the results presented.",

First, we exploit time and spatial variation across German cities and show that higher concentration is associated with more persistent local business cycles, and local concentration Granger causes local employment volatility. From a business cycle perspective, we find evidence in favor of granularity-driven recessions only. Next, we calibrate a structural model along the lines of Carvalho and Grassi (2019) and find that the more fat-tailed productivity distribution in bigger cities crucially depends also on the higher probability that firms will grow.",

The proposed procedure is called targeted undersmoothing. Functionals considered include dense functionals that may depend on many or all elements of the high-dimensional parameter vector. The sensitivity analysis is based on systematic enlargements of an initially selected model. By varying the enlargements, one can conduct sensitivity analysis about the strength of empirical conclusions to model selection mistakes. We illustrate the procedure's performance through simulation experiments and two empirical examples.",

We propose a deterministic method, based on a variational mean-field approximation of the ERGM's normalizing constant. We compute lower and upper bounds for the approximation error for any network size, adapting nonlinear large deviation results. This translates into bounds on the distance between true likelihood and mean-field likelihood. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that in practice, our deterministic method performs better than our conservative theoretical approximation bounds imply, for a large class of models.",

Scenario analysis suggests that once accounting for the influence of structural shocks on the autoregressive coefficients, the effects of monetary policy on economic activity are larger and more persistent than in an otherwise standard TVP-VAR. Our results also indicate that cost-push shocks play a prominent role in understanding historical changes in inflation-gap persistence.",

Randomly selected households in Comoros were offered up to US$320 in cash in exchange for their participation in public works projects. We find that the program increased international migration by 38%; from 7.8%; to 10.8%;. The increase in migration appears to be driven by the alleviation of liquidity and risk constraints.",

This paper evaluates the welfare consequences of automakers forgoing performance increases to raise fuel economy as standards have tightened since 2012. Using a unique data set and a novel approach to account for fuel economy and performance endogeneity, we find undervaluation of fuel cost savings and high valuation of performance. Welfare costs of forgone performance approximately equal expected fuel savings benefits, suggesting approximately zero net private consumer benefit from tightened standards.",

We find that minority leaders improve coordination, and majority leaders do not. Alternative treatment arms reveal that affirmative action for minorities reverses this result, while intergroup contact improves the effectiveness of leaders of both identities.

This paper departs from the parametric model, using a semiparametric formulation that reveals the explicit role that singularity of the long run conditional covariance matrix plays in determining multicointegration. The semiparametric framework has the advantage that short run dynamics do not need to be modeled and estimation by standard techniques such as fully modified least squares (FM-OLS) on the original I1 system is straightforward. The paper derives FM-OLS limit theory in the multicointegrated setting, showing how faster rates of convergence are achieved in the direction of singularity and that the limit distribution depends on the distribution of the conditional one-sided long run covariance estimator used in FM-OLS estimation. Wald tests of restrictions on the regression coefficients have nonstandard limit theory which depends on nuisance parameters in general. The usual tests are shown to be conservative when the restrictions are isolated to the directions of singularity and, under certain conditions, are invariant to singularity otherwise. Simulations show that approximations derived in the paper work well in finite samples. The findings are illustrated empirically in an analysis of fiscal sustainability of the US government over the post-war period.",

Based on asymptotic expansions of the null and non-null distributions of the t-ratios derived under the many instruments asymptotics, we show that the second-order terms of those expansions may have non-trivial impacts on the size as well as the power properties. Furthermore, we propose adjusted t-ratios whose approximation errors for the null rejection probabilities are of order O(n\u22121) in contrast to the ones for the unadjusted t-ratios of order O(n\u22121/2), and show that these adjustments induce some desirable power properties in terms of the local maximinity. Although these results are derived under homoskedastic errors, we also establish a stochastic expansion for a heteroskedasticity robust t-ratio, and propose an analogous adjustment under slight deviations from homoskedasticity.",

We provide a comprehensive analysis of a convolution smoothed approach that achieves adequate approximation to computation and inference for quantile regression. This method, which we refer to as conquer, turns the non-differentiable check function into a twice-differentiable, convex and locally strongly convex surrogate, which admits fast and scalable gradient-based algorithms to perform optimization, and multiplier bootstrap for statistical inference. Theoretically, we establish explicit non-asymptotic bounds on estimation and Bahadur\u2013Kiefer linearization errors, from which we show that the asymptotic normality of the conquer estimator holds under a weaker requirement on dimensionality than needed for conventional quantile regression. The validity of multiplier bootstrap is also provided. Numerical studies confirm conquer as a practical and reliable approach to large-scale inference for quantile regression.

A two-stage method is introduced for estimating parameters in the fO\u2013U process based on discrete-sampled observations. In the first stage, H is estimated based on the ratio of two second-order differences of observations from different frequencies. In the second stage, with the estimated H, the other parameters of the model are estimated by the method of moments. All estimators have closed-form expressions and are easy to implement. A large sample theory of the proposed estimators is derived. Extensive simulations show that the proposed estimators and the large-sample theory perform well in finite samples. We apply the model and the method to the logarithmic daily RV series of various financial assets. Our empirical findings suggest that H is much smaller than 1/2, indicating that the RV series have rough sample paths, and that the mean reversion parameter takes a small positive number, indicating that the RV series are stationary but have slow mean reversion. The proposed model is compared with many alternative models, including the fractional Brownian motion, ARFIMA, and HAR, in forecasting RV and logarithmic RV.",

A semi-explicit hedging formula is derived for our general framework which applies to a myriad of the option pricing models proposed in the discrete-time literature. We conduct an extensive empirical study of the impact of modelling features on the hedging effectiveness of S&P 500 options. Overall, we find that fat tails can be credited for half of the hedging improvement observed, while a second volatility factor and a non-monotonic pricing kernel each contribute to a quarter of this improvement. Moreover, our study indicates that the added value of these features for hedging is different than for pricing. A robustness analysis shows that a similar conclusion can be reached when considering the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Finally, the use of a hedging-based loss function in the estimation process is investigated in an additional robustness test, and this choice has a rather marginal impact on hedging performance.",

We then propose and justify a fixed-design residual-based bootstrap resampling approach for model averaging. In a local asymptotic framework, we show the validity of the bootstrap in estimating the variance of a combined forecast and the asymptotic covariance matrix of a combined parameter vector with fixed weights. Our proposed method preserves non-parametrically the cross-sectional dependence between different models and the time series dependence in the errors simultaneously. The finite sample performance of these methods is assessed via Monte Carlo simulations. We illustrate our approach using an empirical study of the Taylor rule equation with 24 alternative specifications.",

The errors in the literature arise because random variability in the bias term has been neglected in earlier research. In stationary regression this random variability is of smaller order and can be ignored in asymptotic analysis but not without consequences for finite sample performance. Implications of the findings for rate efficient estimation are discussed.

I propose an alternative approach that allows for heteroskedasticity, achieving identification with a conditional mean restriction. These identification results apply to a latent Gaussian error term with flexibly parametrized heteroskedasticity.

As suggested by economic theories, the correlation structure among assets differs between emerging markets and developed countries. It is therefore imperative to make rigorous statistical inference on correlation matrix equality between the two groups of countries. However, if the traditional vector-valued approach is undertaken, such inference is either infeasible due to limited number of countries comparing to the relatively abundant assets, or invalid due to the violations of temporal independence assumption. This highlights the necessity of treating the observations as matrix-valued rather than vector-valued. With matrix-valued observations, our problem of interest can be formulated as statistical inference on covariance structures under sub-Gaussian distributions, i.e., testing non-correlation and correlation equality, as well as the corresponding support estimations. We develop procedures that are asymptotically optimal under some regularity conditions. Simulation results demonstrate the computational and statistical advantages of our procedures over certain existing state-of-the-art methods for both normal and non-normal distributions. Application of our procedures to stock market data reveals interesting patterns and validates several economic propositions via rigorous statistical testing.",

The key element in the minimax problem is that the worst case is over a class of distributions of the data which is invariant to a group of permutations. First, I show that given any assignment vector and any estimator, the uniform distribution over the same group of permutations, namely the complete randomization scheme, is minimax optimal. Second, under further assumptions on the class of distributions and the objective function, I show the minimax optimal estimation scheme involves completely randomizing an assignment vector, while the optimal estimator is the difference-in-means under complete invariance and a weighted average of within-block differences under a block structure, and the number of treated units is determined by the Neyman allocation.",

The model naturally captures the phase transitions of the epidemic growth rate via change-points and further enjoys great interpretability due to its semiparametric nature. On the methodological front, we advance the nascent self-normalization (SN) technique (Shao, 2010) to testing and estimation of a single change-point in the linear trend of a nonstationary time series. We further combine the SN-based change-point test with the NOT algorithm (Baranowski et al., 2019) to achieve multiple change-point estimation. Using the proposed method, we analyze the trajectory of the cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths for 30 major countries and discover interesting patterns with potentially relevant implications for effectiveness of the pandemic responses by different countries. Furthermore, based on the change-point detection algorithm and a flexible extrapolation function, we design a simple two-stage forecasting scheme for COVID-19 and demonstrate its promising performance in predicting cumulative deaths in the U.S.",

We find that within-quarter nowcasts for the output gap are more reliable than for output growth, with monthly indicators for a credit risk spread, consumer sentiment, and the unemployment rate providing particularly useful new information about the final estimate of the output gap. An out-of-sample analysis of the COVID-19 crisis anticipates the exceptionally large negative output gap of \u22128.3% in 2020Q2 before the release of real GDP data for the quarter, with both conditional and scenario nowcasts tracking a dramatic decline in the output gap given the April data.",

For example, a 10 percentage point increase in the positive test rate is associated with a 2 percentage point increase in the death rate among reported cases. The model forecasts perform well, even relative to models from epidemiology and statistics.",

This paper develops a procedure to estimate an individualized vaccine allocation policy under limited supply, exploiting social network data containing individual demographic characteristics and health status. We model the spillover effects of vaccination based on a Heterogeneous-Interacted-SIR network model and estimate an individualized vaccine allocation policy by maximizing an estimated social welfare (public health) criterion incorporating these spillovers. While this optimization problem is generally an NP-hard integer optimization problem, we show that the SIR structure leads to a submodular objective function, and provide a computationally attractive greedy algorithm for approximating a solution that has a theoretical performance guarantee. Moreover, we characterize a finite sample welfare regret bound and examine how its uniform convergence rate depends on the complexity and riskiness of the social network. In the simulation, we illustrate the importance of considering spillovers by comparing our method with targeting without network information.",

We show that the estimator is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. To facilitate easy and precise estimation of the variance matrix, we propose the parametric bootstrap method. Simulations demonstrate the advantages of the estimators.",

We contrast the implications of two monetary frameworks: one, where the central bank follows a standard rule aiming exclusively at price stability against the other, where monetary policy additionally leans against fiscal influence. The latter rule improves economic outcomes by providing appropriate incentives to the fiscal authority. More importantly, the additional fiscal conditionality can enhance the credibility of the central bank to achieve price stability. We emphasise how the level and structure of government debt emerge as key factors affecting the credibility of monetary policy with fiscal conditionality.",

This phenomenon is characterised by stronger employment polarisation in larger cities, both at the occupational and the worker levels. We quantitatively evaluate the role of technology in generating these patterns by constructing and calibrating a spatial equilibrium model. We find that faster skill-biased technological change in larger cities can account for a substantial fraction of spatial polarisation in the United States. Counterfactual exercises suggest that the differential increase in the share of low-skilled workers across city size is due mainly to the large demand by high-skilled workers for low-skilled services and, to a smaller extent, to the higher complementarity between low- and high-skilled workers in production relative to middle-skilled workers.",

The officials discounted the price of land that they sold to the said firms, and were subsequently rewarded with board appointments upon retirement. Specifically, these \u2018client officials\u2019 are three times as likely to be recruited by the \u2018patron firms\u2019 as board directors and enjoy a salary that is 23% higher, and 81% more company shares by comparison with directors who did not help firms to secure cheap land deals. All of these, however, are conditional on patron firms being able to receive a price discount, which averaged 19.4% when they purchased them in normal times. However, when client officials were constrained from providing a price discount during a surprise audit, the likelihood of client officials recruited as board directors was halved, with the price discount and extra compensation received by the patrons and clients, respectively, vanishing altogether. By providing evidence of the reciprocal benefits received by both parties, we demonstrate that the revolving door is used as a \u2018payment\u2019 rather than a \u2018connection\u2019 device in the Chinese context.",

Job-to-job flows are adversely selected, which implies that internally promoted managers are more productive than those who are externally promoted.

We also find that higher wage offers raise application rates for job seekers with wage offers above reservation wages and that\u2014among the latter\u2014the increase in application rates is stronger for those with higher reservation wages.

These effects are more pronounced for low-ability students, persistent for at least 14 years and carry over to economic long-run outcomes. Moreover, we document a pronounced asymmetry: Students who receive negative rather than positive shocks react more strongly. Our findings therefore provide evidence on how the school environment can have long-lasting consequences for individuals\u2019 well-being.",

I find that aid eligibility has no effect on student outcomes when the academic requirements are comparable with most existing national grant schemes worldwide.

The identification exploits the introduction of a new welfare system in Spain during the 1980s and 1990s, and uses a novel narrative series of legislated pension changes as an instrument for pension income. Despite public pensions having a limited impact in the aggregate, I find a high, though less than unity, marginal propensity to consume for pensioners due to permanent income shocks at the household level. Moreover, large spending responses for pensioners with the highest income and wealth mean that liquidity considerations can be disregarded as a key source of marginal propensity to consume heterogeneity. Instead, a strong precautionary savings motive can explain the excess smoothness of consumption, and costly adjustments explain the skewed spending response for durables.",

Second, dams constructed post-1950 had only modest effects on growth. The first result indicates agglomerative impacts on local economic activity. The second result suggests that the cheap-local-power advantage created by hydropower attenuated after 1950, probably because of such innovations as high-tension transmission lines.",

To identify the causal effect of campaign speeches, we exploit several estimation strategies, including a within-county difference-in-differences design and a neighbour-pair fixed effect estimator. We find that campaign visits by Bryan increased his vote share by about one percentage point on average. This increase likely stems from the persuasion of previously non-aligned industrial workers.",

Using monthly customs data in China from January 2017 to May 2019, we find that the launch of the trade war against Chinese exports by the US on average reduces Chinese total exports to the US by 16.47%. Further decomposition shows that the reduction in exports is mostly explained by a decrease in quantity, with prices relatively unchanged. Meanwhile, negative trade shocks cause export diversion to countries that are closer and have larger economies, and exports in R&D-intensive, skilled-labor-intensive, high-capital-income-share, and upstream industries have been diverted even more. Heterogeneous analyses show that industries with a comparative advantage, high export growth, large export value, and high elasticity of substitution are more responsive to trade protection.",

This spillover effect is driven by provisions that are nondiscriminatory and address regulatory issues, as they make member countries more \u201csimilar\u201d, thus allowing to reduce entry costs. Indeed, firms exporting regulation-intensive products benefit disproportionately more from deep trade agreements in destination markets.",

In our novel dataset on instrument-specific haircuts suffered by private creditors in 1999\u20132020 we find larger losses on short- than long-term debt, independently of the specific haircut measure we use. A standard asset pricing model rationalizes our findings under two assumptions, both of which are satisfied in the data: increasing short-run restructuring risk in the run-up to a restructuring, and high exit yields. We relate our findings to the policy debate on restructuring procedures.",

We provide evidence that this caused suppliers to substitute towards Mexican-produced methamphetamine. Using a difference-in-differences identification strategy, we show that the treatment effect of precursor controls on lab seizures was largest in the middle of the United States. This is consistent with substitution towards imports, where differences in each region's ability to substitute towards imports generates heterogeneous effects on domestic production. To quantify the effect of precursor controls on domestic costs and imports, we estimate a model of illicit methamphetamine production using data on lab seizures and methamphetamine prices. We find that precursor controls increased domestic costs by 114%\u2013190%. Substitution towards Mexican-produced methamphetamine decreased the effect of precursor controls on methamphetamine prices by 62%\u201383%, relative to a counterfactual world without import substitution.",

The ELB is an interest rate threshold below which monetary easing becomes contractionary because of adverse effects on credit supply. A tightening in global monetary and financial conditions increases the ELB and may force central banks to hike rates even though domestic economic activity contracts. We also show that the ELB gives rise to a novel inter-temporal trade-off for monetary policy and calls for using a broad range of policy tools to restore monetary transmission.",

The geographical dimension of the data reveals that almost half of these exports of \u201csourced\u201d products are purely intermediated: to many destinations, firms export sourced products only. We find that this type of intermediation is ubiquitous across firms, products, and destinations, and is robust to a battery of alternative definitions. These findings show that trade intermediation by producers (TIP) is not solely driven by carry-along trade, where produced and sourced products are bundled when exported. Our decomposition of TIP highlights that trade intermediation should be identified at the firm-product-destination level. The prevalence of pure intermediation for all manufacturing exporters, including the largest ones, suggests that intermediation plays an important role in firms' participation and success in international markets.",

We find that tariff and migration policies jointly accounted for 30% of China's export growth. We also find evidence that suggests a positive interaction effect of tariff and migration policies. As migration reform prepared the country to become more export oriented, China enjoyed faster export growth after opening to trade than it would have otherwise.",

We analyze the substantial sudden appreciation of the Swiss franc post removal of the 1.20-CHF-per-euro lower bound in 2015 using export data representing a large share of the universe of goods exports from Switzerland. We find that firms upgrade the quality of their products after the appreciation. Furthermore, they disproportionately remove lower-quality products from their product ranges. This quality upgrading and quality sorting effect accounts for a substantial share of the total pass-through one year after the appreciation. We cross-check our results with the microdata underlying the Swiss export price index, which includes an adjustment factor for quality based on firms' reported product replacements, and obtain similar results.",

Using firm-level data on corporate bond issuances in 16 emerging market economies (EMEs) between 2003 and 2017, we find that EME companies are more likely to issue bonds in foreign currency when US interest rates are low. This effect is driven by non-exporters. Interestingly, capital controls on bond inflows significantly decrease the likelihood of issuing in foreign currency and can even eliminate the adverse impact of low US interest rates. In contrast, macroprudential foreign exchange regulations increase foreign currency issuances among nonfinancial companies.",

The literature tackled them separately: i) strategic complementarities for exporting firms to mitigate the pass-through to consumer prices and ii) intermediate inputs trade to enhance cross-border spillovers. We prove that foreign intermediate inputs also efficiently address the pass-through dimension, but, unlike strategic complementarities, solve the exchange rate pass-through disconnect puzzle. These results carry over to the general equilibrium effects of a depreciation. Furthermore, we show analytically that both types of vertical integration weaken sharply the expenditure switching effect. This feature strengthens real synchronization in response to productivity and monetary policy shocks, but lowers it in response to private demand shocks, a point which complements the existing literature.",

The mean quarterly MPC across Peruvian income deciles is 0.204, which translates to a mean annualized MPC of 0.545\u20130.592 under both model-free and model-based annualization methods. To compare Peruvian and U.S. MPCs reflecting the different reference periods of the underlying surveys, I employ a standard incomplete-market model. Two striking differences emerge. First, the mean annual MPC in Peru is three times as large as that in the U.S. Second, the MPCs are substantially more heterogeneous over income deciles in Peru than in the U.S. The model predicts that precautionary saving behavior drives both the higher mean MPC and stronger MPC heterogeneity in Peru.",

Using data on FX transactions with a precise identification of Algorithmic trading (AT), we find that AT, broadly defined, appears to have contributed to the deterioration of market quality following the removal of the cap on the Swiss franc on 15 January 2015 by withdrawing liquidity and generating uninformative volatility. We also find that the Swiss National Bank, after initially stepping aside, played an important role, though more by signalling rather than trading. This perhaps explains why human trading \u2013 that could most easily interpret those signals \u2013 was important in stabilising the market.",

Claims against patent-infringing imports entering the United States may be filed before the International Trade Commission (ITC) or in district court. The ITC applies injunctions (import prohibitions) that would seem to provide more protection from infringing imports than the standard license fee remedy in court. Settlements prior to legal adjudication are common in both venues. Using a model with Nash bargaining and Cournot competition, we show that an ITC filing may restrict imports by less than in court. This result tends to apply if product differentiation is high and the size of the patented cost-reducing innovation is large.",

In this paper we explore whether the form of accumulation affects country risk. We first present a model of endogenous sovereign debt defaults, where we show that reserve accumulation through the issuance of debt contingent on local output reduces spreads in a way that reserve accumulation with foreign borrowing does not. We confirm this model prediction when taking the theory to the data. These results suggest that attention should be placed on the way reserves are accumulated, a distinction that has important practical implications. In particular, our results call into question the benefits of programs of reserves strengthening through external debt such as those typically implemented by multilateral organizations.",

This paper shows that unemployment insurance keeps older workers from depleting their 401(k) assets following job losses. Unemployment insurance also incentivizes older unemployed workers to delay claiming their Social Security benefits beyond the earliest age of eligibility, 62. Overall, unemployment insurance enhances the retirement income of the individuals having a history of late-career layoffs by helping them preserve their 401(k) assets, maintain the return on these assets and opt for a higher stream of Social Security benefits.",

Our field experiment complements a tax enforcement reform in the Dominican Republic a year before our intervention. Sharing information about prison sentences or the public disclosure of evasion arising from the tax enforcement reform increases tax revenue by $184 million (0.22% of GDP). Using a unique sample that covers the entire firm size distribution, we show that the largest firms, that pay 84% of all corporate income taxes and typically have been excluded from this type of intervention, are highly responsive to our information treatments.",

Exploiting a tax reform from Pakistan that cuts the tax rate on five major industries of the country substantially, I estimate the size and nature of VAT evasion in the treated industries, finding that it ranges from 31\u201346% of the potential revenue. One important channel through which the evasion occurs is the overclaim of refunds, which constitute 11\u201323% of the potential revenue. Roughly two-fifths of the overclaimed refund is based on spurious invoices issued by invoice mills. Qualitatively, noncompliance is stronger in the latter stages of the supply chain, but it runs deep inside the chain, suggesting that on their own the self-enforcement mechanisms built into a VAT do not deter tax evasion fully.",

We use a regression discontinuity design that exploits the fact that in some faculties, enrollment in the fourth (honors) year is governed by a grade-based eligibility rule. Students with average grades in their third year just above the threshold are significantly more likely to complete the fourth year and have higher earnings after graduation relative to students who narrowly missed the grade cutoff. The implied earnings return to the additional year of college is about 12 % six months after graduation. Linked administrative tax data confirm persistent gains in the longer run for at least 4 years after graduation. Moreover, the return remains substantial even after the university lowers the threshold to encourage more students to enroll in the fourth year, suggesting an effect not entirely driven by signaling of student ability.",

Contrary to the game-theoretic prediction, both leaders and citizens engage in corruption. Importantly, corruption in the game is correlated with real-world corruption by leaders: citizens send bribes to leaders whom we observe appropriating community money.

In municipalities where a left- instead of right-wing mayor has been elected, the share of immigrants in the population grows faster by 1.5 p.p. within six years after the elections, and by 3 p.p. within twelve years. To a large extent, these effects are driven by partisan differences in public housing constructions and changes in the composition of the population within existing public housing units. They also are associated with greater incumbency advantage, in line with a model of strategic partisan behavior.",

We exploit admission cut-offs in over-subscribed programs and estimate the effect of gaining access to a) any secondary school vs no access, b) general vs vocational school, and c) selective vs less selective general school. Our results show that admission to any secondary school has a sizeable negative effect on the propensity to commit crime. There are no effects at the other two margins. The negative effects at the extensive margin are largest in the years following school admission and result in a reduction of the probability of ever committing crime rather than simply delaying the onset of crime. Our results suggest that keeping youth at school at a critical age has effects that last beyond years where effects on enrollment are observed.",

In this paper, we consider these two forces jointly and study the optimal nonlinear taxation of internationally mobile workers in general equilibrium. We show that both forces partly offset each other. In general equilibrium, migration may lower the bottom tax rate but raises the top tax rate, challenging the classical migration-threat argument. Moreover, we demonstrate that migration responses weaken the trickle-down rationale. Both findings can be explained by a novel wage effect on migration and a migration effect on wages, calling for higher top tax rates to amplify pre-tax wage inequality and prevent high-skilled emigration. We calibrate our model to the U.S. economy and illustrate the new effects by comparing the optimal tax schemes with and without migration, as well as with and without endogeneity of wages.",

After CRNAs were granted practice independence, we find only modest (3%) reductions in anesthesiologist billing for CRNA supervision and no evidence of greater use of CRNAs.

We argue that it is because governments in these countries do not rely on taxation, which is an important instrument for citizens to hold their governments accountable. Using a game-theoretic model, we show that the combination of low taxes and weak governance can be an equilibrium in an economy with sizeable mineral revenues. As income from natural resources ultimately declines, replacing it with tax revenues may require governments to give control of these proceeds to citizens, in the form of cash transfers say, as a credible commitment to accountability, thereby breaking the country out of its resource curse.",

In Punjab, Pakistan, we document that political interference routinely protects doctors from bureaucratic sanction, while personal connections between doctors and politicians and a lack of political competition are associated with more doctor absence. We then examine how politics impacts the success of an at-scale policy reform to combat absenteeism. We find that the reform was more effective at increasing doctor attendance in politically competitive constituencies, both through increased monitoring and through senior health officials being able to respond more effectively to the data gathered on poor performing clinics. Our results demonstrate that politics can block the success of reform; instead of lifting poor performers up, the reform only improved places that had already been performing better. The evidence collectively points to the fundamental importance of accounting for political incentives in policy design and implementation.",

A carbon-tax policy that reduces carbon emissions by 35 percent\u2014broadly consistent with Biden Administration\u2019s new Paris Agreement commitment\u2014can generate mild positive long-run effects on consumption and output, an expansion in the number and fraction of firms that use green technologies, and greater labor force participation, with marginal changes in the unemployment rate. In the short term, the adjustment to a higher carbon tax need not be accompanied by losses in output and consumption or a substantial increase in unemployment. Abstracting from green technology adoption implies that the same policy has substantial adverse short- and long-term effects on labor income, consumption, and output. Our findings highlight the importance of considering endogenous technology adoption in assessments of the labor market and aggregate effects of a carbon tax.",

Incorporating perceived best practices from previous initiatives, the CCTC combines explicit eligibility thresholds with some discretion on the part of program officials to select tax credit recipients. The structure and implementation of the program facilitates rigorous evaluation. We exploit detailed data on accepted and rejected applicants to the CCTC, including information on the scoring of applicants with regard to program goals as well as on funding decisions, together with restricted-access American Community Survey (ACS) data on local economic conditions. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that each CCTC-incentivized job in a census tract increases the number of individuals working in that tract by close to 3 \u2013 a significant local multiplier. Local multipliers are larger for non-manufacturing awards than for manufacturing awards. CCTC awards increase employment among workers across socioeconomic groups and in more- as well as less-advantaged neighborhoods, but have limited impact on residents of affected communities. We validate our empirical strategy and confirm our core results using an alternative dataset and recently developed difference-in-differences methods that correct for potential biases generated by variation in treatment timing and treatment effect heterogeneity.",

Our results show that municipalities that face more violence experience higher rates of student out-migration. In receiving schools in areas not directly affected by violence, adding a new peer who was exposed to local violence to a class of 20 students decreases incumbents\u2019 academic performance by 2 percent of a standard deviation.

Using electronic health records, we exploit within-facility quasi-random assignment of providers, who differ in their opioid prescribing tendency, to 650,000 new patients enrolling in care with the Veterans Health Administration. We find that assignment to a PCP who prescribes opioids at a 2.54 percentage point (pp) higher rate (equivalent to the average difference between a 90th and 10th percentile prescriber within a facility) increases the probability of long-term opioid use by 20% (or 0.43 pp) and development of opioid use disorder by 4% (or 0.035 pp). Veterans\u2019 mental health deteriorates: the three-year likelihood of a depression diagnosis increases by 1.3% (or 0.31 pp). We find that PCPs with more cautious prescribing behavior rely more on non-opioid pain management and adhere more to clinical recommendations on naloxone distribution.",

Tax evasion is concentrated at the top of the wealth distribution with over 10% of the wealthiest 0.01% of households \u2013 the \u201csuper rich\u201d \u2013 evading taxes. At the top, households evade around 8% of their true tax liability. The \u201cmerely rich\u201d (P90-P99.9) own 67% of hidden wealth, while the \u201csuper rich\u201d account for only 7%. Consequently, the correction for offshore wealth has a modest effect on top wealth shares. We describe a number of explanations for the distribution of tax evasion by Dutch households: low-cost tax evasion opportunities in neighbouring countries for the \u201cmerely rich\u201d, sophisticated forms of tax evasion for, low effective tax rates on and migration to low tax jurisdictions by the \u201csuper rich\u201d.

Using a pollution dispersal model to characterize resulting spatial changes in pollution concentrations, we find the program caused EJ gaps in PM2.5, PM10, and NOx from these facilities to narrow by 6\u201310% annually.

We quantify survey fatigue by randomizing the order of questions in 2\u20133 hour-long in-person surveys. An additional hour of survey time increases the probability that a respondent skips a question by 10%\u201364%. Because skips are more common, the total monetary value of aggregated categories such as assets or expenditures declines as the survey goes on, and this effect is sizeable for some categories: for example, an extra hour of survey time lowers food expenditures by 25%. We find similar effect sizes within phone surveys in which respondents were already familiar with questions, suggesting that cognitive burden may be a key driver of survey fatigue.",

However, in towns it reduces population and nightlight density, the size of the non-agricultural sector, and large-firm activity.

The estimated risks, which we treat as objective risks, are then compared with the corresponding subjective probabilistic beliefs, which are elicited by an interactive method with visual aids. Our results show that, on average, the respondents slightly underestimate the change in risk when switching from cooking with firewood to cooking with liquefied petroleum gas, even though their beliefs are qualitatively correct.

We obtained administrative transaction data from a sample of Filipino migrants who were clients of a popular money transfer operator (MTO). We then surveyed these migrants as well as their primary remittance recipients about the same remittance flows. Migrant-reported remittances are only 6% lower than MTO administrative records, and we cannot reject their equality. A custom smartphone app designed to facilitate migrant remittance reporting does not help raise reporting accuracy. Recipient-reported remittances are 23% lower than migrant reports on average. Recipients under-report even more when they receive remittances less frequently and when remittances make up a lower share of household income.",

Estimations, based on the entropy balancing method, show that mobile money significantly increases tax revenue in mobile money countries relative to non-mobile money countries. This result remains robust to various robustness tests and may depend on time perspective, the type of mobile money service, and some structural factors, including a country's level of development, corruption level, rural population size, inflation rate, education level, tax revenue sample 25th percentile and average, revenue administration efficiency, and mature markets. A first level of disaggregation of tax revenue into direct and indirect tax revenue shows that mobile money increases both types of tax revenue, with a larger impact on direct tax revenue. A second level of disaggregation of these two components into different sub-categories shows that the effect on direct tax revenue is driven by personal income tax revenue and corporate income tax revenue and that on indirect tax revenue is determined by taxes on goods and services. Finally, a broadening tax base (proxied by GDP per capita), better institutional quality, and tax payment process simplification are the main channels through which mobile money adoption increases tax performance in developing countries.",

Panel data from 1858 to 1937 suggest that the program generated positive effects on civilian firm entry, but these effects appeared only after the government relaxed constraints on the entry of private firms. Long-term analysis shows that counties that received more military investment through the program, driven by plausibly exogenous ex ante political connections, had greater output in civilian industries in the 1930s. Analysis of the mechanisms suggest that the program boosted local economies through input\u2013output linkages, human capital accumulation, and the rise of modern banks.",

Using a demand-side, industry-specific measure of time-sensitivity, we assess the effect of Chinese competition on the export performance of Eastern European transition economies into Western European (EU15) destination-product markets. Our empirical analysis relies on exploiting the increase of Chinese competition in global markets during the first decade of the 2000s. We find evidence of heterogeneous adjustments to Chinese competition among Eastern European exporters due to the differential importance of timely delivery across sectors (i.e. time-sensitivity). While we observe sizable real displacement effects, they appear to be at least 50 percent smaller for time-sensitive exports. Relying on firm-level customs data, we establish that this mechanism also plays a role for responses to Chinese competition within firms.",

Standard poverty measurement requires collecting household consumption data, which is rarely collected by phone. To test the feasibility of collecting consumption data over the phone, we conducted a survey experiment in urban Ethiopia, randomly assigning households to either phone or in-person interviews. In the phone survey, average per capita consumption is 23 percent lower and the estimated poverty headcount is twice as high than in the in-person survey. We observe evidence of survey fatigue occurring early in phone interviews but not in in-person interviews; the bias is correlated with household characteristics. While the phone survey mode provides comparable estimates when measuring diet-based food security, it is not amenable to measuring consumption using the \u2018best practice\u2019 approach originally devised for in-person surveys.",

Theoretically, restrictions induce (1) a substitution effect away from restricted goods and (2) a negative wealth effect if transfers are extra-marginal and the resale of goods is costly. The welfare impact on transfer recipients is negative. We test these predictions by exploiting a natural experiment in a refugee settlement in Kenya, where some refugees receive monthly cash transfers restricted to food while others receive unrestricted transfers. In line with theory, we find that restricted transfers increase participation in a shadow resale market and negatively affect non-food expenditure, temptation-goods spending, and subjective well-being. Consistent with theory, restrictions have no significant effect on food consumption. Our results show that policy-makers should avoid restrictions to maximise positive impacts on transfer beneficiaries, especially when extreme poverty implies that transfers are extra-marginal.",

Available labor statistics mostly come from surveys in developing countries, which mostly rely on one person providing information about all household members. However, there are only a few empirical studies that provide a framework for understanding the potential advantages and disadvantages of using self and proxy reporters to collect such data. Using self and proxy reports from surveys in Ghana, we find significant differences in estimated labor productivity with very different implications in terms of policy-making. We find that differences in reporting are most likely due to gender and marriage satisfaction of both self and proxy reporters, so differences in reporting are due to bias and are not classical measurement error.",

Research focused on contexts close to full employment has suggested a substantial role of firms in labor market inequality. Using matched employer\u2013employee data from South Africa, I find that firms explain a larger share of wage variation than in richer countries. I consider drivers of this, documenting first a higher productivity dispersion as found for other developing countries. Secondly, I estimate the separations elasticity by instrumenting wages of matched workers with firm wages, and I find a low separations elasticity. This generates a high degree of monopsony, and the correspondingly high estimated rent-sharing elasticity helps explain the important role of firm wage policies in inequality. Monopsony may be driven by higher unemployment, and regional heterogeneity provides suggestive evidence for this. Such firm-level competitive dynamics may exacerbate inequality in developing countries more generally.",

The model dynamics show that if access to irrigation can be regulated by villagers, the two institutions reinforce each other. However, non-excludable irrigation crowds out risk sharing (as is the case with government-managed irrigation). I estimate the framework on data from three villages in India and use it to quantify the relationship between informal insurance and irrigation, and the welfare impact of irrigation public policy.",

However, this effect is entirely concentrated on women, and women granted a loan catch up with men\u2019s enrollment levels. This heterogeneity is not explained by lower incomes in the sample of women. It implies that women have lower access to credit, or that their options for managing without a credit are more limited than men\u2019s.",

With original data from Burkina Faso, we replicate the finding that PMT outperforms CBT at baseline. But this pattern disappears for households\u2019 poverty status 12 and 30 months later where both methods perform equally well.

We solve the model using Taylor projection, a solution method that is shown to deal effectively with high-impact weather shocks calibrated in accordance to empirical evidence. We find large and persistent effects of weather shocks that significantly impact the income convergence path of disaster-prone countries. Relative to non-disaster-prone countries, on average, these shocks cause a welfare loss equivalent to a permanent fall in consumption of 5.3 percent. Welfare gains to countries that self-finance investments in resilient public infrastructure are found to be small, and international aid has to be sizable to achieve significant welfare gains. In addition, it is more cost-effective for donors to contribute to the financing of resilience before the realization of disasters, rather than disbursing aid after their realization.",

We tackle the potential endogeneity of teacher\u2019s subjective beliefs by controlling for teacher fixed effects in a value-added model that includes lagged test scores of students. We find that a standard deviation increase in the biased attitude of the math teacher increases the female disadvantage in math performance by 0.09 standard deviation over an academic year. We also find significant impacts on the gender gap in students\u2019 math attitude, academic self-confidence, and effort as potential mechanisms for the effect on math score.

Using harmonized microdata from national household surveys for 15 Latin American countries, we build a synthetic panel of cohorts that potentially transition from school to work and observe their labor market outcomes 10 years later. We find that men who faced higher unemployment rates at ages 18\u201320 suffer a negative effect on employment at ages 27\u201330. In contrast, women from those same unlucky cohorts have higher employment rates and earnings. Our results are consistent with women acting as secondary workers in downturns. We also find that initial labor market conditions correlate with the role played by women within the household and to perceptions about gender roles later in life. Such higher empowerment could be a result of increased female labor participation and at the same time might act as a mechanism underlying the persistence of the positive effects on female labor outcomes.",

We conducted a randomized experiment in Malawi to test three alternatives to achieving these goals: a) helping firms obtain a business registration certificate that offers formal market access but imposes no tax obligations; b) helping firms obtain both business and tax registration; and c) supplementing business registration with a bank information session. We find incredibly high demand for obtaining a formal status that is separate from tax obligations, and very low take-up of tax registration. Business registration alone has no impact on formal market access or firm performance. However, combining registration assistance with the bank information session increases firm sales by 20 percent and profits by 15 percent. The results highlight the advantages of separating business and tax registration, but also the need to help firms benefit from their new formal status.",

To tackle data shortage, I use high-resolution satellite data to construct a fine measure of agricultural fires as well as other geographic characteristics at 1 km \u00d7 1 km resolution for China. Using the staggered arrival of biomass power plants, which purchase crop residues as production inputs from nearby areas, as a shock to economic incentives, I find a more than 30% drop in agricultural fires in the vicinity of a plant after its opening relative to areas farther away. Such drop cannot be explained by structural transformation, migration, or enhanced regulation near the plant, and is consistent with an incentive-based explanation. I then examine the effectiveness of a command and control policy that bans agricultural fires within 15 km of airports. Using a spatial regression discontinuity design, I find no evidence that such policy works.",

Identification stems from diary\u2013recall differences in reports from the same household, does not require reports to be error-free, and hinges on a research design with broad replicability. Our strategy delivers practical and cost-effective suggestions for designing survey modules to yield the closest measurements of household well-being. We find little empirical support for the claim that acquisition diaries yield the most accurate measurement of poverty and inequality and offer new insights to interpret and reconcile diary\u2013recall differences in household surveys.",

Using estimates from a structural model, we find that the different propensity to switch is better explained by differences in the valuation of the new account rather than differences in the cost of switching. Experience using financial products can thus improve financial decision making.",

While exploring a novel administrative data set on impoverished people in a Chinese county, we discovered that the program significantly increased the participants\u2019 income by 9.61%, driven mainly by the increase in wage income. The empirical findings are consistent with the Roy-model perspective, which states that rural households with comparative advantage in non-agricultural sectors could benefit from relocation to nearby towns. This study provides new evidence that mobility barriers across sectors exist even on a small geographic scale in rural areas.

We employ a difference in differences design, comparing mothers of children older than the age cutoffs used to assign the children\u2019s custody to the mother, to mothers of younger children, before and after the reform. The first group of women is less affected by the legislative change in terms of being able to make credible divorce threats because it faces higher divorce costs, including the loss of alimony and the marital house.

We find that idiosyncratic shocks account for more than 40 percent of the volatility of aggregate sales. Although quite large, this contribution is smaller than documented in previous studies based on advanced economies, despite a higher degree of market concentration in Chile. We show that this finding is explained by larger firms being less volatile and by weaker propagation effects across Chilean firms.",

Many countries have raised the legal age of marriage, but the incidence of early marriage remains high. We propose a simple test for whether laws are effective in deterring early marriage and apply it to data from both the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) covering over 100 countries using statistical tests derived from the regression discontinuity literature. By this measure, many countries are not enforcing the laws on their books, and enforcement may be not be improving over time. We argue that survey data provides a simple way to test if laws are being enforced and are binding, and interpret our results to show that legal change needs to be accompanied by better enforcement and greater monitoring to be effective.",

Under the US African Growth and Opportunity Act of 2000, the employment of women in ready-made garment (RMG) factories in new industrial zones greatly increased. Subsequent shocks to international demand for textile products created by the phase-out of the Multi-Fibre Agreement and the 2008 Financial Crisis temporarily reduced well-paid RMG work opportunities. Women residing closer to the industrial zones were particularly affected. These changes are exploited for identification of causal impacts. Employment in the RMG sector is found to substantially increase women\u2019s say in decisions about the allocation of household resources and own health.",

Although the cameras are useful in sanctioning drivers, they can also capture the passive (shirking) or active (rent-seeking) corruption of officers. Accounting for the spatial and temporal variations in the operation of the cameras, we find that the presence of a functioning camera results in an increase in on-the-ground tickets. Although we do not rule out possible decreases in rent-seeking behavior, a decline in passive corruption appears to be driving the increase in officer ticketing behavior, particularly for the most common vehicles and violations that can be observed from the CCTV cameras. Our findings indicate that remote monitoring technology can serve, if not a substitute for, then as a complement to on-the-ground enforcement.",

We study the case of Manaus, Brazil, where sewer connections vary considerably across the city and property taxes are calculated in a presumptive manner that does not account for a household\u2019s access to sanitation. We find that households with access to the city sewer system are significantly more likely to pay their property tax, relative to households that only have access to latrines or lack access to improved sanitation entirely. Our evidence is consistent with a role for the social contract in this decision, as households with sewer systems are more likely to have positive attitudes towards the municipal government.",

Using household survey data from India, we show that households located farther away from the forest spend more time in fuelwood collection. These households are likely to sell more fuelwood and buy less. That is, reduced access to forests increases fuelwood collection and sale. This counter-intuitive behavior is triggered by the higher fixed costs of households living farther from the forest arising from larger travel times. By combining two different datasets, we can quantify net fuelwood sales out of a village. We show that a fifth of the fuelwood collected is consumed outside of rural areas, in nearby towns and cities. Our estimates suggest that fuelwood burning may account for roughly 14%\u201320% of the typical daily PM2.5 load in a city like New Delhi.",

Two types of offenders drive the impacts: (i) property crime specialists\u2014inmates with a prior conviction for violent or non-violent theft; and (ii) trainees\u2014inmates with different criminal records but who interacted heavily with specialists during incarceration. We examine whether participation in rehabilitation programs or longer prison spells mitigate these effects and find no evidence for either type of offender. Although we are unaware of how many crimes these offenders would commit absent incarceration, these results suggest that incarceration\u2019s specific deterrence or rehabilitation effects might be weak for these populations and that, in some circumstances, prison can foster rather than prevent crime.",

This is due to increased productivity of all trucks, not just those associated with the company managing the privatized treatment centers.

First, we propose a principal\u2013agent model under political uncertainty. Firms can induce market distortions by making transfers to incumbents, but such incumbents may be displaced in an election. Direct capture acts as an insurance for the firm, guaranteeing that its paid for distortions are kept in place even when the incumbent loses. We then show that policies thought to decrease state capture, such as improved bureaucrat selection, can have little to no effect once substitution towards indirect control is accounted for. We test the model\u2019s predictions using a novel database on contractual arrangements between politicians, political brokers and businessmen in Benin. As proposed by the theory, we find that an increase in political uncertainty is associated with an increase in direct forms of capture. We conclude that electoral competition is not a sufficient mechanism to curb firms\u2019 control of government when they can switch forms of state capture.",

It generates a treatment status (exposure to the adverse effects of conflict) that goes beyond violence incidence. This paper develops a new approach to capture such treatment. Violence is modeled as a space\u2013time stochastic process with an unknown underlying distribution that is backed out of the observed pattern of conflict events. A new risk measure is built from this density and used to evaluate the impact of conflict on child health using data from Ivory Coast and Uganda. The empirical evidence suggests that conflict is a local public bad, with cohorts of children exposed to high risk of violence equally suffering major health setbacks even when this risk does not materialize in violent events around them.",

Official electoral data show that the radio campaign significantly decreased the vote share of parties that engaged in the most vote buying (as reported by journalists). Voter survey data show that the campaign increased the salience of corruption as an election issue and decreased voting for parties that offered gifts. From a policy perspective, we show that radio campaigns are a cost-effective method to influence voter behavior. From a measurement perspective, we show that journalist interviews can impartially identify vote-buying parties.",

By exploiting varying degrees of tariff reductions across industries, we find that firms that are more affected by competitive shocks experience a larger relative increase in their foreign ownership compared with those less affected. In addition, we find a stronger (weaker) effect for firms with a greater (lesser) demand for external financing and technology, which indicates the strategic role of foreign shareholders in empowering domestic firms to obtain financing and new technologies in a competitive market.",

From 1930 to 1960, Puerto Rico experienced one of the fastest increases in life expectancy in history and completed the first mortality transition outside of Europe and Western offshoots. Using municipal-level data in an event study framework, I show that public health units (county health departments) caused around half of the reduction in infant and tuberculosis mortality from 1923 to 1945, without significantly increasing public expenditures. Public health units also reduced maternal mortality and stillbirths. I present descriptive evidence that more assistant midwives per capita correspond to larger declines in maternal mortality, suggesting the importance of the training of midwives by health units. This investigation provides a window into Latin America more broadly, since most countries in Latin America subsequently adopted public health units.",

In 2010, a series of reforms to the U.S. health care system resulted in a shift in demand from legal opiates to heroin. This demand shock had considerable effects on Mexico, the main supplier of heroin consumed in the United States. We exploit variation in potential opium production at the municipal level in a difference-in-differences (DID) framework, which compares Mexican municipalities with different amounts of opium-suitable land before and after 2010. We find that people fled out of municipalities more suitable for opium production, many to areas close to the U.S. border and into the United States. This is due to the increase in violence and conflicts, as municipalities more suitable for opium became highly valuable to drug cartels. Overall, almost 95,000 people migrate within Mexico and 22,000 emigrate to the United States.",

Based on a collective household model, we develop a methodology to identify intra-household resource allocation and the extent of joint consumption. Unlike existing approaches, we do not require consumption data on single-person households, which are rare in low-income countries. We illustrate our methodology using data from Bangladesh and Mexico. We document intra-household consumption inequality in both countries and substantial economies of scale in consumption in Mexico but not Bangladesh. Using our estimates, we then compute poverty rates for men, women, and children. Contrary to existing poverty calculations that ignore either intra-household inequality or economies of scale in consumption, ours account for both dimensions.",

By experimentally varying the content of a messaging campaign targeted to civil servants implementing a school maintenance program in Peru, we test the effectiveness of reminders and treatments making salient either monitoring, social norms, the possibility of public disclosure of noncompliance, or audit risk. All messaging treatments improve compliance by similar magnitudes, increasing the probability of submitting a key expense report by an average of 3.9 percentage points over a base of 74%. The inability of this large-scale experiment to detect differential impacts by treatment arm is consistent with timely reminders being the main driver of increased compliance. We explore generalizability across time and populations in two supplemental experiments, confirming the promise of such campaigns to improve civil servant performance when the state lacks enforcement capacity.",

With financial data from locations along the South Indian coast we estimate the causal effect of this major natural disaster on financial flows between occupational groups, the price of credit and other loan characteristics. We find that the supply of funds in these credit networks remained remarkably stable, while demand by small and medium-scale entrepreneurs increased significantly. In response, substantial funds were channeled from wage-employed members and commercial investors to entrepreneurs. We conclude that natural disasters affect individuals with substantial heterogeneity and that the Roscas we study offer more scope for gains from trade in response to a seemingly aggregate shock than commonly assumed for traditional credit and insurance networks.",

Most of the key legislative changes were introduced between 1949 and 1953. The cornerstone of this racially stratified legal system was the Population Registration Act of 1950, which required that all South Africans needed to be registered and assigned to an official racial category. We study the effect of racial classification in the context of these legislative reforms, by estimating the causal effect of being classified as White, relative to being classified as Coloured, on labour market outcomes. For identification we exploit a policy change that privileged ancestry over appearance in the process of racial classification for those born after 1951. Using census data from 1980, 1991, and 1996, we find a discontinuity in racial shares for cohorts born after 1951. Our preferred estimates indicate that being classified as White resulted in a more than fourfold increase in income for men. This corresponds to over 90% of the difference in mean incomes between men in the two population groups. Our findings for women are inconclusive.",

I use historical links between arms exporters and importers, and shocks to conflict engagement of the exporters, to instrument the volume of arms imports. The 2SLS estimates reveal that arms imports in Africa increase the likelihood of internal conflict, in particular one-sided violence, the number of fighter and civilian deaths, as well as the number of refugees fleeing the country. The results suggest that arms exporters have the ability to influence violence with their trade. Even if stopping exports might only postpone violence until more weapons are found, the momentary reduced violence could open a window to facilitate negotiations for a peaceful resolution.",

We present a hybrid targeting method that incorporates CBT\u2019s emphasis on local information and preferences with PMT\u2019s reliance on verifiable indicators. Specifically, we outline a Bayesian framework for targeting that resembles PMT in that beneficiary selection is based on a weighted sum of sociodemographic characteristics, but we instead propose calibrating the weights to preference rankings from community targeting exercises. We discuss several practical extensions to the model, including a generalization to multiple rankings per community, an adjustment for elite capture, a method for incorporating auxiliary information on potential beneficiaries, and a dynamic updating procedure. We further provide an empirical illustration using data from Burkina Faso and Indonesia, which shows that our method achieves error rates lower than what PMT achieves when targeting household expenditures.",

We provide evidence of likely mechanisms behind the program\u2019s negative effect: it inadvertently increased misinformation about HIV transmission methods, and worsened HIV-related stigmatizing attitudes. Subsequent household-level randomized treatments providing correct information and addressing stigma concerns counteract the program\u2019s negative effect on HIV testing.

In a difference-in-differences framework, we show that districts in Pakistan where the historical presence of religious institutions is higher, rule of law is worse. This deterioration is economically significant, persistent, and likely explained by religious leaders gaining political office. We explain these findings with a model where religious leaders leverage their high legitimacy to run for office and subvert the Courts. We test for and find no evidence supporting several competing explanations: the rise of secular wealthy landowners, dynastic political leaders and changes in voter attitudes are unable to account for the patterns in the data. Our estimates indicate that religious leaders expropriate rents through the legal system amounting to about 0.06 percent of GDP every year.",

A simple system where government transfers are paid to those who stay home, financed by lump-sum taxes, could have achieved results similar to this health based lockdown.",

We find that both differences in inflows into and in outflows from unemployment are important for accounting for the regional dispersion in unemployment rates. Within a search- and matching model with risk-averse agents, moral hazard, endogenous separations and free mobility we show that an optimal policy response to labor market dispersion requires a place-based tax and unemployment insurance system together with place-based policies conditioning on labor market flows. We allow regions to differ along multiple dimensions and characterize the trade-offs between insurance, regional redistribution and efficiency quantitatively. We find that for Germany a move towards an optimal place-based tax system that explicitly conditions on regional characteristics could lead to sizeable welfare and employment gains.",

Using a fully nonlinear New Keynesian model with endogenous policy regime switching, we show that a moderate inflation-driven switching probability to a debt-financing regime reduces money-financed spending multipliers. When interacted with high government debt, money-financed spending multipliers fall below one, similar to the size of debt-financed spending multipliers. This result holds at the zero lower bound, with long-term government debt, and under a wide range of key parameter values. Policy regime uncertainty, on the other hand, has little effect on debt-financed spending multipliers.",

Using machine learning to evaluate free-form chat communication among firms in a laboratory experiment, we identify typical communication patterns for both explicit cartel formation and indirect attempts to collude tacitly. We document that firms are less likely to communicate explicitly about price fixing and more likely to use indirect messages when sanctioning institutions are present. This effect of sanctions on communication reinforces the direct cartel-deterring effect of sanctions as collusion is more difficult to reach and sustain without an explicit agreement. Indirect messages have no, or even a negative, effect on prices.",

We are the first to consider internal (i.e., within-firm) job transitions. Specifically, we examine the impact of German firms\u2019 FDI into the Czech Republic on the likelihood of onshore employees up- or downgrading to occupations that are more or less intensive in analytical and interactive tasks. To do so, we match firms with similar investing probabilities. We use this sample to estimate proportional hazards models to retrieve the dynamic effects on workers. We find that FDI increases the average likelihood of upgrades and downgrades by 17% and 19%, respectively. These effects are the strongest for jobs with low shares of nonroutine and interactive tasks, and they increase over time. They become substantial two years after the investment and reach 32%\u201346% and 35%\u201348%, respectively. FDI does not increase the hazard of worker\u2013firm separations. Our results highlight the importance of internal firm restructuring, which enables firms to satisfy their altered domestic labor needs after FDI.",

We assess analytically what this risk-taking channel implies for optimal monetary policy in a tractable New Keynesian model. We show that this channel creates a motive for the planner to stabilize the real rate. This objective conflicts with the standard inflation stabilization objective. Optimal policy thus tolerates more inflation volatility. An inertial Taylor-type reaction function becomes optimal. We then quantify the significance of the risk-taking channel for monetary policy in an estimated medium-scale extension of the model. Ignoring the channel when designing policy entails non-negligible welfare costs (0.7% lifetime consumption equivalent).",

We add to the relevant literature by allowing for a more detailed tax structure, different types of infrastructure spending and linkages between the final and intermediate goods sectors. We find long-run output multipliers above unity if the rising public debt, triggered by the increase in infrastructure spending, is stabilised by rises in consumption, dividend and labour income taxes and less than unity for corporate taxes. We also find that self-financing rates associated with infrastructure spending are not generally above 50% despite underprovided private and particularly public capital. Finally, a sensitivity analysis reveals that intersectoral linkages and zero-interest rate policy are critical determinants of multiplier size.",

By calibrating the model to the euro area, we show that optimal QE favors purchases from the smaller region (Periphery instead of Core), given that the former faces stronger portfolio frictions.",

Reliance damage is defined as the difference between the counterfactual benefit that the counterpart would have obtained had they not relied on the promise and that which they would obtain following a breach. We discuss two motivational mechanisms that could drive such an effect. One is that people intrinsically dislike causing reliance damage per se. The other is that people dislike causing regret in another person. We experimentally test these ideas in the context of an experimental trust game. Our evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that promise keeping is affected by reliance damage, and that the underlying mechanism involves a desire not to cause regret in others.",

We test the classical view that inflation reduces output and welfare by taxing monetary exchange. Inflation is engineered by constant money growth where newly-issued money is injected in one of three ways: to finance government spending, lump-sum transfers, or proportional transfers. Experimental results largely support theoretical predictions. Higher money growth leads to higher inflation. Output and welfare are significantly lower with government spending, output is significantly lower with lump-sum transfers, while there are no significant real effects with proportional transfers. A deviation from theory is that the detrimental effect of money growth depends on the implementation scheme and is stronger with government spending relative to lump-sum transfers.",

Immigrants have a comparative advantage in production at, and lower disamenity cost for nighttime work, which leads them to disproportionately choose nighttime employment. Because day and night tasks are imperfect substitutes, the relative price of day tasks increases as their supply becomes relatively more scarce. We provide empirical support for our theory. Native workers in local labor markets that experienced higher rates of immigration are more likely to work day shifts and receive a lower compensating differential for nighttime work.",

The threat of competition pushes firms to enter earlier to preempt their rivals while the possibility of learning makes them cautiously wait for others to take action. This combination amounts to a new class of timing games where a first-mover advantage first emerges as in preemption games but a second-mover advantage later prevails as in wars of attrition. Our model identifies under what conditions a firm becomes a pioneer, early follower or late entrant and provides efficiency implications by highlighting an elusive link between static market competition and dynamic entry competition.",

We recruit professional rice buyers (middlemen) to act as judges in a rice competition by providing a quality rating and a price quote for rice samples that we randomly associate with farmers bearing ethnic majority or minority names. First, we find that there is no ethnic difference in buyers\u2019 evaluation of rice quality. Second, we find that local buyers, who have local monopsony power, discriminate against ethnic minority farmers by quoting a lower price for their rice relative to that of ethnic majority farmers. Third, we find that wholesale buyers, who face fierce competition in the marketplace, do not price discriminate against ethnic minority farmers. A second lab-in-the-field experiment and survey information indicate that both local and wholesale buyers are prejudiced against ethnic minority farmers. This suggests that market competition can eliminate the discrimination of wholesale buyers.",

The Bayesian Information Criterion avoids this problem, though the inflexibility of its parameter penalty appears to cause poor performance in certain settings.",

Research in VAR models has also empirically identified IST news shocks as a significant driving force behind the U.S. business cycle. However, recent New-Keynesian DSGE models have found that IST news shocks do not produce comovement of aggregate variables, with the share of the forecast error variance explained by IST news shocks being very small in a flexible-price model and essentially zero in a sticky-price model. This paper uses the Bayesian methods to estimate the parameters and shock processes to study the business cycle effects of IST news shocks in a two-sector sticky-price DSGE model with consumer durables and collateral constraints. Our variance decompositions indicate that IST news shocks are a more relevant source of uncertainty than IST non-news and other shocks.",

The uncertainty indices computed from January 2000 to May 2019 capture episodes of regulatory change, trade tensions and financial stress. In an evaluation exercise, we use a structural vector autoregression model to study the effects of uncertainty on investment and on private consumption. We document considerable effects for the political and domestic regulation uncertainty components on investment, while the other types show heterogeneous effects across countries. For instance, trade uncertainty influences Germany\u2019s investment more than its counterparts. Moreover, we observe strong negative effects of uncertainty on consumption for countries such as Italy (political) and Spain (fiscal, political and domestic regulation).",

To overcome the usually severe selection issues, we exploit a unique migration lottery that randomly assigns access to residence permits for (prospective and current) workers with an employment contract in Liechtenstein, which is situated centrally in Europe. Using an instrumental variable approach, our results show that lottery compliers raise their employment probability in Liechtenstein by on average 24 percentage points across outcome periods (2008 to 2018) as a result of receiving a permit. Relatedly, their activity level and employment duration in Liechtenstein increase by on average 20 percentage points and 1.15 years, respectively, over the outcome window. These substantial and statistically significant effects are predominantly driven by individuals not (yet) working in Liechtenstein prior to the lottery rather than by previous cross-border commuters, but even for the latter group (generally living relatively close to the border), important positive employment effects emerge in the longer run. Indeed, we find both the labor market and residential effects to be persistent even several years after the lottery with no sign of fading out. These results suggest that granting resident permits to foreign workers can be effective to foster labor supply, despite the alternative of commuting cross-border from adjacent regions.",

If linking costs are sufficiently high, poorer players may contribute more and have more central positions in the network than richer ones do. In large societies, free riding reduces inequality only in networks in which it is initially low. Otherwise, richer players free ride more, as they can afford more links.

With rational expectations, price level targeting (PLT)\u2014the limiting case of average inflation targeting (AIT)\u2014is optimal, yet AIT with sufficient history dependence reaps most of the benefits of PLT. With boundedly rational expectations, PLT is no longer optimal unless the degree of bounded rationality is small. When deviations from rational expectations are sufficiently large, outcomes can be worse under PLT or AIT with strong history dependence than under IT. Finally, for both variants of the model, inflation conservatism improves welfare by eliminating the deflationary bias without invoking history dependence.",

Unlike customs data aggregated at the product category, typically used in the trade literature, model-level data allow us to test for the presence of nonhomotheticities by comparing market shares of identical models across different markets. We measure quality at the model level, account for varying willingness-to-pay for quality at different incomes, and link quality measures to objective model attributes. Using originally assembled data on the country of manufacture of each model, we study patterns of quality specialization by brands with plants in multiple countries. We find that firms locate the production of their higher-quality models in richer countries and argue that the home-market effect linked to nonhomothetic preferences is a key driver of such patterns of quality specialization.",

IRFs show that shocks to required capital persistently reduce R.W.A. and loan supply and lead to a temporary decline in GDP. Based on historical decomposition, the ST and the CA increased banks\u2019 Tier 1 ratio by 40 bps and determined a contraction in loan supply and GDP after two years of up to 1.5% and 0.5%, respectively.

No central bank explicitly expresses their conduct via a policy rule, which contrasts with models of policy. Central banks often connect theory with practice by publishing inflation forecasts that can, in principle, implicitly convey their reaction function. We return to this central idea to show how a central bank can achieve the gains of a rule-based policy without publicly stating a specific rule. The approach requires central banks to specify an inflation target, inflation tolerance bands, and provide economic projections. When inflation moves outside the band, inflation forecasts provide a time frame over which inflation will return to within the band. We show how this communication replicates and provides the same information as a rule-based policy. The communication strategy produces a natural benchmark for assessing central bank performance. We illustrate these features in a counterfactual monetary policy history of the United States.",

The model incorporates all economic activities as classified by the European System of Accounts (ESA 2010) and includes all economic sectors populated with millions of heterogeneous agents. In addition to being a competitive model framework for forecasts of aggregate variables, the detailed structure of the ABM allows for a breakdown into sector-level forecasts. Using this detailed structure, we demonstrate the ABM by forecasting the medium-run macroeconomic effects of lockdown measures taken in Austria to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

The results suggest a large impact of taxes on asset shifting between affiliates, increasing with expected patent income, and driven by very large firms. Patent boxes are persistently associated with more incoming and less outgoing patent relocations between affiliates. These findings suggest that taxes provide firms with incentives to shift income via patent relocation, and advocate for considering patent transfer strategies in tax policy.",

This leaves a significant role for employer-provided paid sick pay in many countries. In this paper, we study who has access to employer-provided sick pay and how much it is valued by workers for themselves and others. We find that workers in jobs with high contact to others are particularly unlikely to have employer provided sick pay, as are economically insecure workers who are least able to afford unpaid time off work. We find that workers without sick pay are more likely to say that they will work when experiencing cold-like symptoms and are less willing to expose themselves to health risks at work during the pandemic. Using vignettes, we reveal that large shares of workers have a very high, but even more have a very low willingness to sacrifice earnings for access to sick pay. Together our findings highlight the unequal distribution of access to sick pay and the potentially strong negative externalities of not providing it publicly. The pandemic may have made these issues more salient as perceived probabilities of having to self-isolate are positively related to support for publicly provided sick pay. Finally, we find that providing information on the health externality of paid sick leave increases support for the public provision of sick pay, suggesting that there might be a public under-provision because individuals do not factor in the externalities.",

To tackle this inaccessibility, it is essential to know which and to what extent minority groups face hiring discrimination. This meta-analysis synthesises a quasi-exhaustive register of correspondence experiments on hiring discrimination published between 2005 and 2020. Using a random-effects model, we computed pooled discrimination ratios concerning ten discrimination grounds upon which unequal treatment in hiring is forbidden by law. Our meta-analysis shows that hiring discrimination against candidates with disabilities, older candidates, and less physically attractive candidates seems equally severe as the unequal treatment of candidates with salient racial or ethnic characteristics. Moreover, hiring discrimination against older applicants is more prominent in Europe than in the United States. Last, while we initially find a significant decrease in ethnic hiring discrimination in (Western) Europe, we find no structural evidence of recent temporal changes in hiring discrimination when controlling for the minority groups considered, at the country level, or based on the various other grounds within the scope of this review.",

Producers are heterogeneous with respect to how productive they are in different states of the world, and may pursue different combinations of safe and/or risky securities issuance when financing projects. I simulate a demographic transition calibrated to replicate the US experience starting in 1880. This transition results in modest increases in output, larger increases in saving as a whole and, particularly, in a relative increase in saving in the form of safe assets. Lower capital costs lead to producer entry (and more issuance) and to a tilt towards safe issuance. I show that omitting this asset supply channel, as standard representative firm models do, results in a quantitatively important overestimation of the transmission effects of the demographic transition, with larger output gains despite smaller interest rate reductions.",

By use of event-study methods and data from the USA, England, and several countries in Continental Europe, we find evidence that health shocks lead to an immediate and persistent decline in cognitive functioning. This robust finding holds in all regions representing different health insurance systems and seems to be independent of underlying individual demographic characteristics such as sex and age. We also ask whether variables that are susceptible to policy action can reduce the negative consequences of a health shock. Our results suggest that neither compulsory education nor retirement regulations moderate the effects, thus emphasizing the importance for cognitive functioning of maintaining good physical health in old age.",

Higher public infrastructure investment should also be more expansive in a liquidity trap than in normal times by raising the potential interest rate and increasing aggregate demand. We analyze the relative merits of these policies in New Keynesian models with and without endogenous private capital formation and heterogeneity when monetary policy does not respond by raising policy rates. Our key finding is that the effectiveness of sales tax hikes differs notably across various model specifications, whereas the benefits of higher public infrastructure investment are more robust in alternative model environments. We therefore conclude that fiscal policymakers in liquidity traps should consider spending opportunities and not merely rely on tax policies to stimulate growth.",

The results show large effects on these measures of consumers\u2019 movements, as well as on both online and offline measures of expenditure, particularly in the first containment period. We also find evidence that consumers adjusted rapidly during the first containment period, mitigating the effects of mobility restrictions via an increasing shift toward online purchasing, and that the nature of the adaptation differed for different types of purchase.",

The medium and long-run effects of conventional and unconventional monetary policy are analysed by combining monetary policy shocks identified in a Structural VAR, and the general government budget constraint featuring a single central bank and multiple fiscal authorities. In response to a conventional easing of the policy rate, the cumulated response of the fiscal deficit is positive. Conversely, in response to an unconventional easing affecting the long end of the yield curve, the primary fiscal position barely moves. This is consistent with the long-run effect of unconventional monetary easing on the price index, which is about half that of conventional easing. The aggregate long-run cumulated surplus is mainly driven by Germany\u2019s fiscal policy during the period in which unconventional monetary policy was adopted.",

We document that the observed reallocation of economic activity since the 1970s towards the service sector has exerted a strongly negative effect on aggregate productivity growth in most European countries. Moreover, we perform a quantitative analysis to show that the expected path of structural change might continue to have a sizeable dent on future productivity growth in Europe. By contrast, the impact in the U.S. is expected to rapidly diminish. We show that this differential result can be explained by the large expansion, in Europe, of certain service sub-sectors characterized by stagnant productivity.",

We capture the endogenous response of rational individuals who choose to reduce inter- and intra-generational social interactions, consumption- and labor-related personal exposure to the virus, while not internalizing the impact of their actions on others. We find that social distancing measures targeted to the elderly (who face higher mortality risk and are not part of the labor force) are best suited to save lives and mitigate output losses. The optimal economic shutdown generates small gains in terms of lives saved and large output losses, for any given type of social distancing. These results are confirmed by calibrating the model to match real epidemic and economic data in the context of a scenario exercise.",

                    "abstract": "The ultimate goal of macroprudential policy is to prevent and reduce the costs of systemic financial crises, and thus contribute to promoting sustainable economic growth. However, despite the active role played by such policies in recent decades, there is still limited empirical evidence regarding whether prudential regulation is effective to enhance financial stability by preventing and mitigating crisis risk. This paper seeks to close that gap by studying the relationship between macroprudential policy and both the likelihood and severity of financial crises. The contribution of the paper is twofold. First, I show that macroprudential policy tightenings are successful at reducing the frequency of systemic financial crises. Moreover, this result holds even if macroprudential policies are implemented when the economy is already experiencing a financial boom or when monetary conditions are rather accommodative. I point to the prevention and mitigation of financial booms as the main transmission mechanism through which macroprudential policy defuses crisis risk. Second, I find that macroprudential policy enhances the resilience of the financial system, by dampening the output losses associated with future systemic financial crises. The latter result implies that macroprudential policy not only makes financial crises less likely, but also less painful.",

This progress notwithstanding, we show using administrative data that immigrant children who grow up in the 20th income percentile place three income ranks lower than native children of similarly low-income parents. This income gap cannot be explained by differences in parent education levels, family structure, or municipality of residence. The gap can, however, be explained by differences in immediate, 100 \u00d7 100 - m neighborhoods. Immigrant children grow up in relatively denser neighborhoods with fewer native-born and high-earning neighbors. Data from Stockholm suggest that immigrant families sort into different neighborhoods than natives due to Sweden\u2019s rental housing allocation mechanism that is based on waiting time rather than market rents.",

We find that 56 percent of jobs are WFH feasible, most of which are located in urban areas and in highly digitized industries. Using individual-level data on tasks and work conditions, we show that heterogeneity in WFH feasibility is largely explained by differences in task content. WFH feasible jobs are typically characterized by cognitive, non-manual tasks, and PC usage. We compare our survey-based measure with popular task-based measures of WFH capacity, which usually rely on determining tasks that are incompatible with WFH, and show that task-based approaches capture variation in WFH capacity across occupations fairly accurately. A simple measure of PC use intensity will generally constitute a suitable proxy for WFH capacity. Finally, we demonstrate that our WFH index is a strong predictor of actual WFH outcomes during the Covid-19 crisis and discuss applications in the context of the pandemic and the future of work.",

The IRRF is negative in half of the OECD countries, and it declines with income inequality. To interpret this evidence we develop a model in which moderately-low-income households take on debt to maintain a consumption threshold (effectively a saving constraint). Now burdened with debt, these households use additional income to deleverage. In more unequal economies with more saving-constrained households, increases in government spending tighten credit conditions less (relax credit conditions more), leading to smaller increases (larger declines) in the interest rate.",

It focuses on Chile, where an electronic bidding system allows retirees to receive offers, simultaneously from several firms in the market for the same standardised annuity product. By exploiting within-individual variation in initial offers across firms, this analysis shows that firms with market power offer more unfairly priced annuities to women than to men. This result is driven by highly rated firms. Gender differences in financial literacy can explain why firms find it profitable to offer higher prices to women.",

Hence, this study considers optimal monetary policy in a two-country model under asymmetric currency pricing (ACP) in which U.S. (Home) firms use producer currency pricing (PCP) while firms in the rest of the world (Foreign) use local currency pricing (LCP). In the ACP model, there is an additional inefficiency, namely, the internal relative price distortion compared with the LCP model and the distortion arising from deviations from the law of one price compared with the PCP model. Consequently, welfare gains from monetary policy cooperation in the ACP model are substantially greater compared with the LCP and PCP models. Moreover, the noncooperative Foreign policymakers in the ACP model can manipulate not only the internal relative price but also deviations from the law of one price in favor of their own welfare through nominal exchange rate adjustment, whereas the noncooperative Home policymakers can control neither. This result rationalizes the fact that the U.S. designates currency manipulators to protect its welfare. Therefore, gains from cooperation in Home are larger than in Foreign. Furthermore, I find that there are substantial gains from cooperation in the ACP model even under the conditions that remove gains from cooperation in the LCP and PCP models.",

In equilibrium, both sellers\u2019 asking prices and time-to-sell increase with the relative size of their outstanding debt. For sellers in financial distress, this behavior results in a positive relationship between debt and their individual risk of default. Prices and time-to-sell determine both the liquidity of the housing market and the aggregate risk of default. As such they determine the extent of profitable lending by competitive lenders. Calibrated to the U.S. economy, the model also generates, as observed, positive correlations (i) across sellers of asking prices with loan-to-value ratios, and (ii) over time of both house prices and time-to-sell with mortgage loan-to-value ratios at mortgage origination. Policies aimed at reducing default may be counterproductive if they raise the value of mortgages and thus lower lending standards, ultimately increasing the rate of default and reducing aggregate welfare. We consider also the implications of these policies for the effects of aggregate shocks on house prices and the rate and severity of mortgage default.",

They also tend to rebalance their liquid portfolio, reduce their degree of leverage and become more inclined to change bank connections. Our results also indicate that it is the event of becoming exposed to negative rates (the extensive margin), not the share of deposits exposed to negative interest rates (the intensive margin), that matters for firm behaviour. These findings support the existence of a corporate channel of monetary transmission when bank deposit rates cross zero and become negative.",

We revisit this result using a general equilibrium macroeconomic framework with labor search frictions. Our theory parses out the extent to which search frictions in and of themselves can distort the DWL-ETI relationship. Numerical analysis suggests that DWL is nearly 10 percent above the ETI given search frictions, only. Accounting for externalities can drive this figure up to about 20 percent, and accounting unemployment benefits can increase this number up to nearly 40 percent. Parsing out these effects both analytically and quantitatively yields novel results that contribute jointly to the public finance and macroeconomic literatures.",

Our main result is that the risk of a Eurozone breakup is significant although, quantitatively, it is not larger than in the period before the COVID-19 shock. In addition, we find that an increase in the redenomination risk in one country is associated with an increase in default premia and bond spreads in other Eurozone countries. Finally, we find that a sizeable fraction of the changes in the cost of insuring against redenomination and default reflects two additional factors: the first captures the insurance cost against a euro depreciation conditional on redenomination, while the second captures liquidity premia.",

During both the heightened market uncertainty and NYSE floor suspension periods, we find a significant increase in hidden liquidity yet significant decreases in both algorithmic trading and market fragmentation. However, despite withdrawing from the market during this period, remaining algorithmic traders appear to improve market quality.

We find that amidst the turmoil as market liquidity declined, ATs did not (disproportionately) withdraw liquidity supply. Stocks with the highest algorithmic trading (AT) experienced lower liquidity reduction compared to stocks with the lowest AT activity. High AT stocks did not experience greater reduction in either competition for liquidity provision or price improvements than low AT stocks. Multiple tests indicate that high AT did not associate with any greater deterioration in price efficiency vis-\u00e0-vis low AT stocks. Stocks in the industries hardest hit by COVID-19 did not see any less AT competition for liquidity supply or price efficiency than stocks in the least affected ones. Overall, our results allay some concerns that the current levels of AT make markets more susceptible to liquidity withdrawal in times of crises.",

Combining the survey results with the financial statements of the respondent firms, we investigate the factors behind the allocation of various government programs. We find that firms that had low credit scores in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, were more likely to apply for and receive the subsidies and concessional loans offered by the Japanese government in 2020, controlling for the sales growth after the onset of the pandemic. Firms with low credit scores are not necessarily zombies, which are defined to be the firms that are non-viable but kept alive by assistance from creditors and/or the government. Our result suggests that the government assistance may have subsidized some poorly performing firms that were not yet zombies before the pandemic.",

The data suggest that PPP abuse was relatively widespread as approximately 25% of firms receiving PPP loans indicated they would retain more jobs in their loan application than the number of employees they disclosed on their most recent regulatory filing (Form ADV). We show an existing model of investment advisor fraud predicts the most egregious PPP loans at a rate similar to actual cases of fraud. Investment advisors abusing the Program were significantly more likely to disclose a history of past fraud and other legal and/or regulatory misconduct. Using a conservative approach, we estimate that more than 6% of the $590 million in PPP funds received by SEC registered investment advisors consisted of overallocations to firms abusing the Program. We test a variety of hypotheses to shed further light on the nature of PPP abuse.",

This suggests that a firm\u2019s IR contributes to value generation by enhancing credibility with shareholders and by diversifying its shareholder base.

We quantify currency-induced balance sheet valuation effects for aggregate external positions as well as for broadly defined asset classes for the first quarter and the full year 2020. To do so, we use new data on the currency composition of cross-border assets and liabilities for 46 countries. In contrast with past financial crises, many emerging markets did not experience losses on their aggregate external balance sheets despite facing a domestic currency depreciation. This was partly due to currency-induced valuation gains on equity positions offsetting losses on debt positions, and partly due to reduced currency mismatch on their external debt positions. We conduct the stock-flow reconciliation of net international investment positions to measure overall valuation effects and compute the proportion that is due to changes in currency values. For about half of the countries in our sample, currency-induced valuation effects were substantial, representing over 50 percent of total valuation effects in 2020Q1 and the full year 2020.",

We observe that country-level determinants such as GDP, political stability, foreign direct investment, and commitment to crisis management (income support, health and lockdown policies) also affect the sensitivity of CDS spreads to COVID-19 infection rates. A negative amplification effect exists for firms with high default probability in countries with fiscal constraints. A direct comparison between global CDS and stock markets reveals that the CDS market prices in a distinct set of corporate traits and government policies in pandemic times.",

We find that growth dynamics remain a stable and sufficient predictor of credit risk incidence over the pandemic period, despite its large, short-lived swings due to government intervention and lockdown. Unobserved component models as used in the recent credit risk literature appear mainly helpful for explaining the high-default wave in the early 2000s, but less so for default prediction above and beyond growth dynamics during the 2008 financial crisis or the early 2020 covid default peak. Government support variables do not reduce the impact of either growth proxies or unobserved components. Correlations between government support and credit risk are different, however, during the financial and the covid crisis. Using the empirical models in this paper as credit risk management tools, we show that growth factors also suffice to predict credit risk quantiles out-of-sample during covid times.",

At the onset of the pandemic, short-selling activity shifted towards companies with low financial flexibility but only in countries with limited fiscal space. Among such companies, short sellers specifically targeted those that generate their revenues mainly in the domestic market. These short sellers entered their positions before the market crash, thereby generating significant abnormal returns. We find no evidence of either herding behavior prior to the market crash or a long-run performance reversal of short sellers. These findings support the notion that short sellers help to promote price efficiency in times of crisis, where governments with budgetary constraints are unable to provide sufficient stimuli to their economies.",

We document that dealers\u2019 internal risk limits came closer to binding during the March 2020 market turmoil. Although dealers eased their limits to accommodate increased liquidity demand, limit adjustments were not enough to offset the increase in risk exposures. We find limit tightness is negatively associated with subsequent inventory growth at dealers\u2019 bond trading desks, especially during the COVID-19 crisis or on days with limit changes. Overall, our results indicate the importance of internal risk limits in driving dealers\u2019 liquidity provision in time of stress.",

These results highlight how periods of crises \u2013 like the pandemic \u2013 affect the destabilizing influence of retail trading. To provide additional evidence, we replicate our empirical exercise during the 2008-09 financial crisis. Consistent with the COVID-19 period, we again find that retail trading leads to more volatility during the financial crisis vis-\u00e1-vis the pre-crisis period.

We analyse how bank stock returns during January\u2013March 2020 relate to the pre-crisis activation of macroprudential policy across 52 countries in a cross-sectional dimension. We find that, overall, a tighter macroprudential policy stance is beneficial for bank systemic risk, as assessed by equity market investors. A robust finding is that a perceived decrease in bank risk stems primarily from the use of credit growth limits, reserve requirements, and dynamic provisioning. By contrast, a pre-crisis build-up of capital surcharges on systemically important financial institutions seems to lower bank stock returns. Alternative bank risk indicators suggest that the latter is likely to be driven by concerns about profits rather than the probability of default.",

To begin with, we examine the extent to which state-level COVID developments influence yield spreads of municipal bonds. We find that macro-level factors are the primary determinants of municipal bond spreads during the pandemic, but state-level COVID developments also matter at the margin. For instance, a doubling of new COVID cases in a state is associated with a 2% (1.4 basis points) increase in yield spreads of municipal bonds issued in that state. Accordingly, lockdowns may decrease municipal bond spreads by reducing COVID cases, but lockdowns may also increase them by reducing local economic activities. Overall, we find that yield spreads in both primary and secondary municipal bond markets increase by about 15% following lockdown announcements, suggesting that lockdown announcements increase the risk premiums investors require for holding municipal bonds.",

We further exploit the staggered short selling deregulations, Google\u2019s withdrawal, and the anti-corruption campaign as three quasi-natural experiments that create plausibly exogenous variations in the quality of information environment. These experiments show that the predictive power of star analysts\u2019 coverage decisions strengthens (weakens) following a sharp deterioration (improvement) in firms\u2019 information environment, consistent with the notion that star analysts possess superior ability to identify mispriced stocks.

Eigenvalue-based approaches, in contrast, provide a scenario-independent measure of systemic stability, but so far only handle a single contagion mechanism. We develop an eigenvalue-based approach that brings the best of both worlds, enabling the analysis of multiple interacting contagion channels without the need to impose a subjective stress scenario. Our model captures the solvency-liquidity nexus, which allows us to demonstrate that the instability due to interacting channels can far exceed that of the sum of the individual channels acting in isolation. The framework we develop is flexible and allows for calibration to the microstructure and contagion channels of real financial systems. Building on this framework, we derive an analytic stability criterion in the limit of a large number of institutions that gives the instability threshold as a function of the relative size and intensity of contagion channels. This analytical formula requires comparatively little data to elucidate the mechanisms that drive instability in real financial systems and thus complements the insights gained from traditional stress tests.",

Using daily yield curve data we estimate shadow rates for the US, Sweden, the euro area and the UK, and document that they fall (rise) as monetary policy becomes more expansionary (contractionary), following announcements of policy rate cuts (hikes), forward guidance, and balance sheet expansions (contractions). In addition, we show two applications for our shadow rate. First, we decompose shadow rate responses to monetary policy announcements into conventional and unconventional monetary policy surprises, and assess the pass-through of each type of policy to exchange rates. We find that exchange rates respond more to conventional than to unconventional monetary policy. Lastly, counterfactual experiments in two DSGE models suggest that inflation in the US and in Sweden would have been on average about 0.8 and 0.33 percentage points lower, respectively, had unconventional monetary policy not been used.",

Average call and put returns are negative at short maturities, more so for OTM options, and increase with maturity. Put returns are less negative than call returns, but this is not the case for delta-hedged returns, indicating that the aggregate risk of the underlying energy futures is priced in the raw option returns. Moneyness patterns in raw and delta-hedged returns are similar to patterns for index option returns. Significant differences between the four commodities remain after removing the effect of the underlying futures returns, with natural gas as the main outlier. Variance risk premiums are negative and explain some maturity patterns in returns, but they cannot account for return differences across markets. Energy producers are net short the underlying through their option positions, and speculators net long. The larger the net long position of the speculators, the lower the returns on call options, which suggests that demand from speculators may affect option returns in energy markets.",

Other things being equal, small banks are riskier than large banks since the latter are more likely to be bailed out. Thus, small banks face a higher cost of non-deposit financing and are unable to finance liquidity shocks at a cost below a certain threshold. Consequently, we show that under a tight monetary regime small bank lending is more sensitive to monetary shocks. This relation reverses under loose monetary regimes where large bank lending is more responsive to monetary shocks. Our empirical results strongly support our analysis.",

Employing a difference-in-differences specification we find that bank failures increased the GINI by 0.3 units (or 0.7%). We show that the rise in inequality is due to a decrease in the incomes of the poor that outpaces declines of the rest. We further show that individuals with lower levels of education exhibit a relatively greater decline in real wages and weekly hours worked. Exploring channels of transmission, we find income inequality is explained by a general decline in small business loans. This in turn reduces net new small business formation and their job creation capacity, a sector that hires a substantial share of low-income earners.",

These four risk metrics, which capture cumulative market \u201cfears,\u201d perform well in the US and in an international sample of countries. The VRP proxy and GR are significant and complementary predictors for several horizons, including under one month (VRP proxy) and longer horizons (GR).

The absence of short sellers consequently results in less negative stock returns for politically connected firms as compared to their non\u2013connected peers.

Indeed, BHCs appear to apply stricter contract terms for syndicate loans to risky and opaque borrowers. We also show that UD law implementation leads to changes in BHC board composition by increasing the proportion of outside directors, the number of independent directors in audit committees and the number of independent directors with financial expertise.",

Managing size strategies according to the two faces achieves significant performance improvements unexplained by common risk factors. Moreover, the two-faced size effect remains robust to stylized facts that invalidate the unconditional size effect. The conditional performance is consistent with the evidence that the prices of small stocks respond slowly to information shocks and is mainly driven by the conditional difference in cash-flow shocks between small and big stocks. Overall, our findings not only show that both small-minus-big and big-minus-small premiums exist but also highlight the necessity of accounting for these two faces when assessing the size effect.",

Accordingly, it is found that asymmetric information at the time of liquidation delays investment and reduces the amount of debt issuance. When the degree of asymmetric information is high, the firm cannot take a mixed financing consisting of risky debt and equity. The firm with collateral takes a mixed financing consisting of risk-free debt and equity, whose debt issuance amount equals the collateral value, whereas the firm without collateral takes all-equity financing. This result contrasts with that under symmetric information, where the firm always issues a mix of risky debt and equity. Moreover, when the degree of asymmetric information is substantial, an increase in cash inflow volatility decreases debt issuance. This result also contrasts with that under symmetric information, where an increase in volatility increases debt issuance.",

Our results suggest that analysts\u2019 forecast errors and dispersion increase with an increase in forex exposure within firms. These findings are robust to a wide range of robustness tests, including a quasi-experimental setting based on the sudden unpegging of the U.S. Dollar against the Chinese Yuan. Additional tests reveal that analysts spend more effort forecasting when firms experience an increase in forex exposure. Consistent with an increase in uncertainty of firm outcomes representing the primary channel through which forex exposure affects analysts\u2019 forecasts, we find that the effect of forex exposure is heightened in the presence of greater volatility in the U.S. Dollar. However, we also find that more readable annual reports and higher media coverage can help improve the quality of analysts\u2019 forecast properties for firms with increasing forex exposure. We also present evidence of some benefits analysts can realize from coverage of high forex exposure firms through generating greater stock trading and securing positions in more prestigious brokerage firms.",

Using grant-level compensation data and a hand-collected sample of monthly repurchases, I find a positive causal relation between executive equity sales and share repurchases. I identify the relation using the vesting schedule of equity grants as an instrument for equity sales. This behavior is persistent across firm, executive, and governance characteristics. Both CFO and CEO vesting schedules impact repurchases, suggesting the CFO may also have influence over the execution of the repurchase program. There is minimal evidence of long-term value destruction. The results indicate executive contracts impact the execution of share repurchase programs.",

In particular, the estimated GARCH models yield a highly persistent volatility component, which allows the leverage effect to hold up until long horizons. Such a persistent volatility component is key to modeling long-term tail risk and pricing long-term put options. Overall, our exercise highlights the usefulness of volatility derivatives in GARCH option valuation.",

We suggest that the release of an imitative product triggers two countervailing forces: a discovery effect that increases awareness and demand for the original, and a substitution effect decreasing that demand. When the imitation is horizontally differentiated, the substitution effect is weaker, and the discovery effect leads to increased demand for the original, particularly so when the original is less well\u2010known. However, when the imitation is vertically differentiated, the discovery effect does not benefit the original, and the demand decreases given the substitution effect. We test our theory in the context of 3D\u2010printable products. Managerial Summary Imitative products typically harm the performance of the original product. This is in part the rationale for deterring imitation by acquiring intellectual property (IP) rights. However, as we demonstrate, the release of an imitative product may increase discovery of the original product, and therefore demand for it. In markets with a large number of products, products typically compete for attention, and an imitative product may serve as a channel through which attention spills over from the imitation to the original. This effect is more pronounced when the original product is less well\u2010known. This suggests that, under certain conditions, firms may benefit from pursuing a more open IP strategy that encourages imitation. Examples of marketplaces where imitation may increase demand for the original include those for music, e\u2010books, software, and mobile apps.",

Simultaneously, the general public is increasingly politically polarized. We examine how CEOs' support for gun control after two mass shootings differentially affected the behavior of liberal and conservative consumers and the persistence of these effects. Using mobile phone location data to measure store\u2010level visits, we find (a) consumer visits to stores decreased by 3%; (b) this decrease was asymmetric: visits in the most conservative counties decreased by about 5% but did not change in the most liberal counties; and (c) these effects dissipated within 10 weeks after activism. Our results highlight the strategic implications for executives pressured to take stances on controversial issues. Managerial Summary We study how consumers respond to CEO support for gun control, and how consumers' partisan views influence their behavior. Visits to the stores of several major retailers declined about 3% in the 4 weeks after their CEOs supported expanding background checks for gun purchases. In the most liberal counties, visits did not change following CEO support for gun control, while in the most conservative counties visits declined about 5%. Hence, the reaction of liberal consumers did not counteract the reaction of conservative consumers. We find, however, that these effects dissipated within 10 weeks; as a result, retailers whose CEOs supported gun control did not experience any long\u2010term, net decrease in sales despite the short\u2010term sales decrease in conservative counties.",

We argue that, regardless of experience or expertise, a learning\u2010based forecasting behavior in which individuals attend to and incorporate new relevant information from the environment into an updated belief that aligns with the Bayesian belief updating process is likely to generate superior industry foresight. However, the effectiveness of such a cognitively demanding process diminishes under high levels of uncertainty. We find support for these arguments using an experimental design of forecasting tournaments in the managerially relevant context of the global automotive industry from 2016 to 2019. The study provides a novel account of individual\u2010level forecasting behavior and its effectiveness in an evolving industry and suggests important implications for managers and entrepreneurs. Managerial Summary How a focal industry will evolve is a key forecasting problem faced by managers and entrepreneurs as they seek to identify opportunities and make strategic decisions. However, developing superior industry foresight in the face of significant change, and limited and often contradictory information, can be especially challenging. We study how individuals forecast the ongoing transformation of the global automotive industry with respect to electrification and autonomy, using a novel research design of forecasting tournaments. A forecasting process in which individuals update their beliefs by neither ignoring prior information nor overacting to new information helps to generate superior industry foresight. There was a significant penalty to forecasting accuracy when individuals did not update their beliefs at all, or when they updated, but overreacted to new information.",

Emphasizing the heterogeneity in audience predispositions, we propose that firms can gain an audience composition premium by strategically positioning themselves to gain more (less) attention from audiences with positive (negative) predispositions toward them. We argue that this approach to strategic positioning is more conducive for firms with high dispersion in their audience predispositions and that firms can increase their ability to gain an audience composition premium by engaging with audiences holding moderately diverse evaluative schemas. We employ recommender systems and topic modeling to analyze 152,312 firm\u2010analyst\u2010year observations from 1997 to 2018 and 297,931 earnings call transcripts of U.S. public firms and find strong support for our predictions. Managerial Summary A key question managers encounter is how to increase their firms' evaluations from external evaluators such as security analysts. In this study, we show that firms can increase their aggregate analyst recommendations by influencing the composition of analysts who opt to cover them and gaining evaluations from analysts who have more favorable predispositions toward them (i.e., by gaining an audience composition premium). Our findings also suggest that gaining an audience composition premium is more important for enhancing a firm's aggregate analyst recommendations when there is a higher dispersion in analyst predispositions toward the firm. To increase its ability to gain an audience composition premium, the firm should engage with analysts who exhibit a moderate degree of heterogeneity in their evaluative schemas.",

Specifically, we find that collaborating with the same partner as a competing firm hurts firm performance but can be leveraged by employees to advance their careers\u2014by using the opportunity to connect with competing firms and find better job opportunities.

We argue that while more precarious situations likely deter some executives from pursuing and/or accepting such opportunities, more hubristic executives' tendencies make them likely to do so despite the associated challenges. Concordantly, those tasked with filling CEO openings likely view more hubristic executives as particularly important for combatting the challenges of more precarious situations, leading them to seek and endorse such executives. Using multiple conceptualizations of precarious situations, we find support for our arguments in a sample of CEO changes in S&P 500 firms. Managerial Summary Why do organizations select more hubristic executives to fill CEO openings? We answer this question by highlighting the role that situational precariousness plays. Specifically, not all CEO openings are equally attractive to prospective CEOs and not all prospective CEOs are equally attractive to decision makers tasked with filling such openings. We argue and find support for the notion that more hubristic executives' tendencies make them more likely to pursue and accept CEO opportunities at organizations in more precarious situations while those tasked with filling CEO openings likewise believe more hubristic executives' tendencies are particularly important given the precarious situations those organizations face.

Our mixed\u2010methods study of the cryptocurrency industry draws on fuzzy\u2010set qualitative comparative analyses (QCA) to analyze archival and interview data and offer new theory on how decentralized platforms coordinate activities to grow in an early\u2010stage, before network effects kick in. We find that, in the absence of a central authority, platforms coordinate activities with three mechanisms, namely decentralized (a) algorithmic coordination, (b) social coordination, and (c) goal coordination. Our QCA treat these mechanisms as explanatory conditions and, using a representative sample of 20 cryptocurrency platforms, reveal which configurations of decentralized coordination mechanisms nurture, or hinder, early\u2010stage platform growth. Managerial Summary Firms operate around a managerial hierarchy that distributes tasks, resources, information, and rewards to organizational members who pursue common goals as contract\u2010bound employees. From 2009, a new organizational form, called the \u201cdecentralized platform,\u201d emerged and diffused without relying on hierarchy nor managerial authority\u2014and without having to employ anyone. The most prominent decentralized platform, Bitcoin, has millions of users, thousands of contributors, and a market valuation never achieved before by an organization without a CEO nor shareholders. This study explicates how this unprecedented level of organizational decentralization functions in practice. We foreshadow implications for the digital economy, wherein \u201cWeb3\u201d innovations, such as non\u2010fungible tokens and DAOs, have already shifted the orchestrating role played by platforms in capitalist societies.",

This discrepancy motivated us to conduct placebo tests in which we randomize managers' spells at their firms. The results with the randomized data are generally as strong as those with the real data, suggesting (a) that the apparent explanatory power of manager fixed effects may be largely a statistical artifact and (b) that managerial \u201cstyle\u201d may manifest itself in more complex ways than can be ascertained from examining financial statement metrics.

We attempt to replicate a leading paper in this body of research but obtain quite different, usually weaker results. We also try repeating the analysis using artificial datasets where managers are randomly assigned to firms other than those at which they really worked. These randomized datasets produce results that are generally as strong as those with the real data.

Using detailed administrative records of patenting decisions and outcomes by one prominent U.S. research\u2010based university's TTO over a 30\u2010year period, we analyze the performance of invention disclosures by academic stars and by inventors with prior licensing experience. We find that the lead inventor's academic prominence (but not licensing experience) predicts patent application filing, while licensing experience (but not academic prominence) predicts patent impact and commercialization success. We supplement this descriptive analysis with follow\u2010up interviews and empirical evaluation of possible mechanisms for this seemingly outsized role of academic stars. Managerial Summary Increasingly prevalent hybrid organizations are expected to fulfill multiple objectives. University technology transfer offices (TTOs) are an example of a hybrid organization and are charged with disseminating academia\u2010originated technology for the public good as well as for economic benefit. We study how one TTO allocates internal resources, using comprehensive in\u2010house administrative data over a 30\u2010year span. We find that while the TTO tends to put resources behind inventions by academic stars, the commercial returns from licensing inventions from such individuals are no different than inventions by non\u2010stars. By contrast, inventors' prior licensing experience highly predicts commercial returns. These results illustrate the challenges inherent in internal resource allocation inside a complex hybrid organization.",

This study presents a politics\u2010based theory of the internal capital market and highlights the methodological potential of quantitative case studies. Managerial Summary Managerial politics presents a vexing yet persistent reality of organizational life and the inter\u2010divisional competition for resources. We attribute its pervasiveness to the contest over non\u2010financial resources with fuzzy ownership and significant yet uncertain value, such as bargaining power over internal transfer pricing, managerial attention, and control over new business opportunities. Because of the zero\u2010sum dynamics of these non\u2010financial resources and their constant scarcity, political contests cannot be suppressed through the provision of financial slack or agency controls and even extend to family members. Appointing rival managers along clearly separated lines of businesses may curb, but not eliminate, managerial politics.

Their superior performance often arises from resources and knowledge accrued during employment in parent firms. An understudied question is whether prior employment in parent firms affects an employee spinout's alliance formation, given that alliances are critical to startups' survival and commercial success. This article examines when an employee spinout's alliance partners overlap with the parent's partners. Drawing on alliance formation patterns of U.S. medical device spinouts founded between 1990 and 2013, we find that spinouts building on their parents' technologies tend to have a greater partner overlap with their parents, whereas product market overlap leads to fewer overlapping partners. Managerial Summary A rich context for entrepreneurs to identify new opportunities is through their employment in existing industry firms. When employees leave their job and create a spinout, their employment experience often provides them superior knowledge and expertise. Our study of medical device startups uncovers another distinctive feature of employee spinouts, that is, access to their employer's alliance partners. However, for such opportunities to come to fruition, entrepreneurs need to pay attention to their technical and product market positioning relative to their past employers. When spinouts build on their employer's technologies without challenging them in the product space, they can leverage connections to their employer's partners. This alliance strategy may free spinouts from the alliance formation struggles faced by resource\u2010deficient startups.",

Thus, unpaid contributors are valuable to the platform, but control over their activities is limited. We study whether and how volunteer communities can provide a competitive advantage and ask how contributor behavior depends on a platform's competitive position. We propose two channels: First, a stronger competitive position facilitates contributor coordination, leading to a larger active community. Second, a platform's competitive position is related to contributor motivation, which drives how much individuals contribute. Studying two competing game wiki platforms, we find that a platform's stronger competitive position is associated with higher activity, primarily driven by the number of contributors, which in turn triggers increased contributions by existing contributors. Further, high\u2010productivity contributors are especially active on a stronger platform. Managerial Summary Online \u201ccrowdsourcing\u201d communities create value for many digital platforms, but managing them in a way that ensures productive contributions is challenging. To better understand the conditions under which online communities create value productively we analyze how contribution patterns differ between more and less successful platforms. We study 13 game wiki communities on two competing platforms and find that success is tied to higher activity, which is in turn the result of more manpower in the value creation process, but also higher productivity by individual contributors. In addition, a dedicated core of highly productive community members is an important driver of platform success.

In a systematic analysis of sequential timeframes between 1978 and 2019, I find a persistent rise in the explanatory power of corporate effects, which has grown to surpass that of industry effects. Consistent with these trends, I also find that an increasing share of multi\u2010business firms is operating only high\u2010performing or only low\u2010performing businesses, which coincides with refocusing efforts that began in the 1980s. This temporal perspective provides an explanation for why prior studies estimating industry and corporate effects have reached different conclusions. Managerial Summary I present evidence that how much industry and corporate parentage each matter to business performance among diversified firms in the United States has changed over time in a systematic way. Specifically, my analyses show that while factors at the industry level may have mattered more than those at the corporate level from the late 1970s through most of the 1990s, this has since reversed and corporate parentage likely explained more of business profitability throughout the 2000s and 2010s than industry membership. These changes coincide with a trend that began in the 1980s toward greater focus and relatedness among the operations of diversified firms.",

This goal has traditionally been achieved using keyword\u2010based approaches, which require researchers to specify a dictionary of keywords mapped to the theoretical concepts of interest. However, recent machine learning (ML) tools for text classification and natural language processing can be used to construct quantitative variables and to classify unstructured text documents. In this paper, we demonstrate how to employ ML tools for this purpose and discuss one application for identifying artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in patents. We compare and contrast various ML methods with the keyword\u2010based approach, demonstrating the advantages of the ML approach. We also leverage the classification outcomes generated by ML models to demonstrate general patterns of AI technological innovation development. Managerial Summary Text\u2010based documents offer a wealth of information for researchers and business analysts. However, researchers often need to find a way to classify these documents to use in subsequent research projects. In this paper, we demonstrate how supervised ML methods can be used to automate the process of classifying textual documents into pre\u2010defined categories or groups. We provide an overview of when such techniques may be used in comparison to other methods, and the considerations and tradeoffs associated with each method. We apply these methods to identify AI\u2010based technologies from all patents in the United States, based on patent abstract text. This allows us to show interesting patterns of AI innovation development in the United States. We also provide the code and data used in this paper for future research.",

Managerial Summary Organizations are increasingly subject to conflicting demands imposed by their institutional environments. Given the importance of governance arrangements, we apply strategic management concepts to public universities and investigate the effect of external governance arrangements on university performance. We show that universities that reallocate resources more regularly are more likely to run larger budget surpluses.

Departing from the conventional focus on the complementarity value that these complements add to platform owners, we examine how uncertainty in the complementary product market drives this decision. We offer a novel perspective on third\u2010party complements\u2014they contain option value allowing the platform owner to defer its own entry into the market. Thus, uncertainty increases investment in enabling complements, especially with greater \u201cdownside risk\u201d in the market or learning\u2010by\u2010observing. We demonstrate this perspective using numerical examples, simulations, and data on Apple's iPhone ecosystem from 2010 to 2015. This perspective brings together literatures on complementarity value and entry into the complementary market, and indicates that complements generate more than complementarity value within platform\u2010based ecosystems. Managerial Summary To manage complements within a platform\u2010based ecosystem, the platform owner needs to understand how complements add value. Conventionally, complements are seen to render the platform more attractive. We offer a different view\u2014complements can be seen as real options for the platform owner to learn about the product\u2010market potential and decide later if it should enter the market with its own product. Using data from Apple's iPhone ecosystem, we demonstrate this option value and show that it is salient when \u201cdownside risk\u201d of the market is high or learning\u2010by\u2010observing is possible. Our analysis suggests that without considering such option value, platform managers may have underestimated the value\u2010add of complements on their platforms.

On the one hand, MPW is deployed to increase employee worktime utilization and productivity, which should be reflected in more timely project completion. On the other hand, MPW also brings switching costs due to attention residue and cognitive setup. Based on this trade\u2010off, we derive an inverted U\u2010shaped relationship between MPW and project performance. We find support for this relationship in a longitudinal dataset containing 9,649 project\u2010month\u2010employee observations. More specialized experience, project similarity, and employee familiarity positively moderate the inverted U\u2010shape. Furthermore, the results are robust to a host of model specifications, data structures, assumptions, and alternative explanations. Managerial Summary How many projects can you work on simultaneously? We study this question in the context of new product development (NPD) projects in a multinational organization. We suggest that multi\u2010project work (MPW) might be a double\u2010edged sword. On the one hand, MPW academics or engineers can be more productive by filling the gaps in their schedules and developing time management practices. On the other hand, MPW also carries switching costs. This trade\u2010off creates an inverted U\u2010shaped relationship between MPW and project performance. So, how can MPW be more beneficial or less costly?

Nonetheless, numerous important research topics involve phenomena that are novel and/or causally complex and so resist basic hypothetico\u2010deductive logic. As a result, many of the most important findings in strategy research have come from open\u2010ended studies of relevant phenomena.

In this introduction we describe the twelve articles in the special issue, focusing on how they contribute to continued development of the question\u2010driven approach to research in strategic management. Managerial Summary One of the frustrations managers have with academic research is that it tends to be driven by questions that are theoretically interesting or lend themselves to clever econometrics. Accordingly, the results can lack managerial relevance.

We introduce a new mechanism, entry diversion, to better understand the empirical phenomenon of persistent firm entry in spite of investments in entry deterrence by incumbents in some industries. Entry diversion happens when preemptive strategic investments by incumbents decrease the expected future profits from a target submarket such that entrants choose to enter another submarket within the same industry. Empirical evidence from the global semiconductor manufacturing industry suggests that incumbents expand their capacities beyond demand growth, and that these investments effectively divert entry into other submarkets. Greenfield entrants are more responsive to entry diversion than incumbents. Managerial Summary Managers have long understood that deterring entry of new players into their industry could sustain their firms' profits. In this article, we introduce a new mechanism, entry diversion, where the incumbent diverts potential entrants from its submarket toward other submarkets in the same industry. Entry diversion happens when preemptive strategic investments by incumbents decrease the expected future profits of the entrant in a submarket of the industry such that the entrant chooses not to enter the incumbent's submarket. Contrary to entry deterrence, new players will still enter the industry but settle in different submarkets. Empirical evidence from the global semiconductor manufacturing industry suggests that incumbents expand their capacities beyond demand growth, and that these investments effectively divert entry into other submarkets.",

We identify a novel approach whereby the firm builds an open institutional infrastructure (OII) by investing in a pool of resources widely accessible beyond its exchange partners. To collectively govern OII, the firm must empower other actors within multilateral cross\u2010sector partnerships, and it must enforce the resulting rules through relational norms based on alignment between public and private value creation. These findings, achieved by adapting Elinor Ostrom's principles of polycentric governance to corporate actors who take the lead in building OII, advance our understanding of new organizational forms that transcend the traditional boundaries of firms and markets. Managerial Summary Emerging markets typically present additional obstacles for business operations because they lack the necessary underlying institutional infrastructure such as access to capital and labor markets. We introduce a new way for firms to overcome these obstacles\u2014which we call building an OII\u2014by investing in such infrastructure themselves and making it available to their commercial partners, local communities, and even to competitors. Firms must empower those actors to take the lead in collectively defining the rules for accessing this infrastructure, by orchestrating cross\u2010sector partnerships.

However, recent theoretical work has posited that the entry decision is an outcome of a learning process and that the information acquired during the pre\u2010entry period shapes subsequent performance dynamics. We provide the first systematic data on the pre\u2010entry period using a nationally representative survey. We document the activities that prospective entrants undertake, finding variation according to opportunity costs, prior experience, and confidence levels. Our results suggest the pre\u2010entry period is shaped by a series of choices by prospective entrants as they contemplate entry, further exploration, or ending the entrepreneurial process. Managerial Summary We created and implemented a nationally representative survey on the entrepreneurial activities of Americans. Several interesting findings emerged. First, approximately a third of Americans report having had a business idea in the past 5 years, motivated in the vast majority of cases by lifestyle concerns rather than the pursuit of significant business opportunities. Fewer than half of those who considered starting a business take even the lowest cost steps, like searching the Internet for potential competitors or speaking with a friend. Our findings reveal an entrepreneurial process which involves a significant pre\u2010entry period where prospective entrepreneurs seek to acquire information about the quality of their idea, perform administrative tasks to prepare for launch and encounter frictions that impede their progress.",

We address this limitation by examining how investors responded to firms that were barely included or excluded from the 100 Best Corporate Citizens list. Contrary to prevailing theoretical expectations, our findings indicate that marginal firms that were included in the ranking experienced negative abnormal returns compared to marginal firms that were excluded. We discuss the theoretical implications of these findings and how they inspire future research questions for scholarship on rankings and status. We also discuss implications for managers that question whether and when being ranked results in financial benefits or liabilities. Managerial Summary Because being ranked is generally seen as an important strategic objective for companies, managers must carefully consider how much attention and resources to allocate toward this pursuit. Although existing research suggests that being ranked can be beneficial, we have a limited understanding about whether barely making a ranked list is worth the effort. We provide new insights for managers by showing that investors not only respond negatively to marginal inclusion on a ranking but also provide suggestions for how companies might counteract this effect. Specifically, our results suggest that making consistent, focused investments that are relevant to external stakeholders may buffer organizations from the potential negative effects of marginal inclusion on a ranking. These insights may also inspire managers to reconsider their firms' commitments to being ranked.",

We examine the role of prior industry experience in the startups' next stage\u2014its hiring of new employees. We tackle two empirical challenges\u2014the mutual aspect of hiring and the effect of unobserved variables on employees' earnings using a two\u2010sided matching model. Our results reveal that even firms founded by entrepreneurs without industry experience can attract new employees with such experience if the founders start with a large entrepreneurial team. Further, startups provide new hires with an earnings premium for their industry experience. Our approach illustrates the benefits of matching models over traditional regressions. Managerial summary Growing startups face the question of who to hire and how much to compensate the new hires. Simultaneously, prospective new hires ask which startup to join and how much their salary will be. We explore these questions using a novel method that tackles the mutual selection process. In the context of five technological manufacturing industries, we find that having industry experience within founding teams may not be necessary to attract new hires with high quality if the startup can signal its own quality through other means such as having a larger founding team. Our results indicate that startups prefer employees with industry experience for which startups offer a wage premium. Thus, employees seeking startup employment benefit from gaining industry experience prior to joining a startup. A video abstract is available at https://youtu.be/w00YzYi5VqA.",

Using lab and field experiments to examine creative imitation in China, we find the effects of creative imitations on the originals depend on the creative imitation's quality. We explore the underlying mechanisms, and show that including a low\u2010quality creative imitation in the retail choice set increases satisfaction with and choice of the original, while a moderate\u2010quality creative imitation does the opposite. Moreover, creative imitation affects consumers' satisfaction with the original by influencing whether their experience with the original verifies their expectations. Our paper reveals creative imitation effects to help incumbent firms effectively address them. Managerial Summary When the incumbent is challenged by an entrant using creative imitation, consumers may react differently to the incumbent, and understanding consumers' reactions allows the incumbent to make better strategic decisions about how to address the challenge. Using lab and field experiments, we investigate creative imitations with two quality levels common in our empirical context, low quality and moderate quality, and examine how and why they differentially affect the originals. We find the presence of a low\u2010quality creative imitation actually increased choice of the original by enhancing consumers' satisfaction with it, while a moderate\u2010quality creative imitation reduced choice of the original by undermining satisfaction with it. Our research suggests the incumbent should address moderate\u2010quality creative imitations' challenges to customer satisfaction, while temporarily tolerating low\u2010quality creative imitations.",

Little research examines how early\u2010stage entrepreneurs decide when and how to change their strategies. With a longitudinal field study of seven entrepreneurial firms developing innovations in energy and cleantech, we examined 93 strategic decisions at risk for change. We found that decision\u2010makers chose to change their strategies only after new information conflicted with or expanded their beliefs. Furthermore, a pivot, or strategic reorientation, was not achieved with a single decision, but by incrementally exiting or adding strategy elements over time, accumulating into a pivot. We contribute a grounded definition of what constitutes a pivot and explain when and how entrepreneurial firms pivot. Managerial Summary The term \u201cpivot\u201d is used extensively by practitioners and scholars alike, yet little is known about when and how entrepreneurial firms actually choose to change their strategies and when that change constitutes a pivot. We find that entrepreneurial firms choose to change their strategies only after receiving new information that conflicts with or expands their beliefs about their firm or uncertainties they face. However, this is more rare than the norm. Rather than make wholesale change with one decision, firms incrementally exit or add a single element to their strategies. A firm pivots and reorients their strategic direction by reallocating or restructuring the firm's activities, resources, and attention through an accumulated series of decisions to address the on\u2010going stream of problems and opportunities early\u2010stage firms confront.",

This trend is shown not only on average across firms, but also within firms over time after alternative explanations are accounted for. To corroborate a link with firm time horizons, we estimate the relationship between an implied discount rate (\u201cIDR\u201d) and factors relevant to firm long\u2010term strategy. We find that IDR is correlated in expected ways with firm investments, management incentives, financial health, ownership, and external pressures\u2014measures that have been argued to correlate with firm time horizons. This article represents one of the first attempts to document market\u2010wide evidence of shortening firm time horizons. These changing horizons bear important implications for firm strategy. Managerial Summary Whether U.S. firms have become more short\u2010term oriented remains an active debate among managers, investors, researchers, and policymakers. In this study, we report that investors have been increasingly discounting the expected future returns of public firms over the last three decades. We find that a firm's discounting rate is explained by signals of its long\u2010term strategy, including investment decisions, ownership structure, financial health, executive compensation scheme, and short\u2010term pressures from the external environment. Our findings indicate a market\u2010wide contraction of firm time horizons, highlighting firm characteristics that suggest how and why firms differ in their time horizons. These demonstrated relationships may help guide firms in devising investment strategies as well as external communications to attract investors that share a firm's preferred time horizon.",

We extend this work by studying whether digitization influences the products created. Using unique data on movies, we examine whether the reduced costs of production and new digital distribution channels spur producers to create products aimed at smaller audiences. We employ a flexible, transparent, and largely graphical empirical approach to document changes unfolding with digitization. We find growth in both intended blockbuster and long tail products, but also, the rise of a \u201cmiddle tail,\u201d movies distributed via digital channels, with budgets suggesting commercial intent but well below the averages for theatrical distribution. The new middle tail is largely due to newcomers rather than major incumbents.

With lower costs, movies no longer need to be \u201cblockbusters\u201d at the box office to be financially successful. In this article, we study whether digitization has spurred an increase in lower\u2010budget movies that are not aimed for release in theaters.

We disentangle competitive interactions from environmental changes to show that a leader's simple rules to either imitate the closest rival in terms of attributes (her neighbor) or the closest rival in terms of rank (her challenger) can help to maintain the performance gap to her competitors. Using a computational model and an empirical test, we find that environmental changes alter the trade\u2010offs between imitation accuracy and the responsiveness to threats from distant rivals. Consequently, when environmental changes are infrequent and minor, neighbor imitation is more effective in maintaining the lead, whereas challenger imitation prevails as environmental changes become more frequent and substantial. Managerial Summary By showing that imitating a lower\u2010ranked rival can help a leader to stay ahead, recent research has overturned the common thinking that imitation is only useful for those trying to catch up with the leader. However, these insights come from contexts in which the leader has only one competitor. Can imitation also be effective for a leader competing against multiple rivals, and whom should the leader imitate? We find that imitation can indeed help the leader to maintain their lead against multiple rivals, but that the choice of imitation target matters and should take the competitive environment into account. In relatively stable environments, imitating your most similar rival works best, while imitating whoever is in second place is a more effective approach in changeable environments.",

Existing research has conceptualized this as a strategic choice bounded by the bargaining power of each stakeholder group, which, we argue, risks misattributing outcomes by neglecting structural constraints. Instead, these dynamics need to be understood within the wider institutional context shaping the behavior of managers and stakeholders. Using a question\u2010driven mixed\u2010methods approach, we investigate the evolution of VCA in three telecom companies located in different institutional systems\u2014British Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, and Telecom Italia. Our findings suggest that national institutional and firm strategic effects must be considered together to understand patterns of VCA among stakeholders. Managerial Summary Using an emerging methodology, we quantify how three telecom firms (British Telecom, Deutsche Telecom, and Telecom Italia) have created and distributed economic value since privatization. Our focus is on explaining the extent to which various stakeholders\u2014employees, customers, capital owners, and government\u2014were able to appropriate the value created by the firms. Some similarities are found across the three companies, but we also found major differences. To explain patterns, we bring together (a) strategic decision making by managers within the firm and (b) constraints imposed by institutions outside the firm. We find both to be important, interlinked drivers of distributional patterns. The article gives managers and stakeholders a means to understand major changes and determinants of value creation and distribution.",

While there is a large body of research examining the relationship between interdisciplinarity and scientific discovery, there is comparatively limited evidence on and understanding of the connection between interdisciplinarity and the generation of scientific findings that address societal problems. Drawing on a large-scale survey, we investigate whether scientists who conduct interdisciplinary research are more likely to generate scientific findings with high societal visibility - that is, research findings that attract the attention of non-academic audiences, as measured by mentions to scientific articles in blogs, news media and policy documents. Our findings provide support for the idea that two facets of interdisciplinarity - variety and disparity - are associated positively with societal visibility. Our results show, also, that the interplay between these two facets of interdisciplinarity has a systematic positive and significant association with societal visibility, suggesting a reinforcing effect of spanning multiple and distant scientific fields. Finally, we find support for the contingent role of scientists' collaboration with non-academic actors, suggesting that the positive association between interdisciplinary research and societal visibility is particularly strong among scientists who collaborate with actors outside academia. We argue that this study provides useful insights for science policy oriented to fostering the scientific and societal relevance of publicly funded research.",

We show that AI innovation presents strong dynamic returns (learning effects) and benefits from complementaries with knowledge earlier developed in the area of network and communication technologies, high-speed computing and data analysis, and more recently cognition and imaging. AI patent productivity increases with the scale of firm innovation, and is lower for companies with narrow technological competences. There is evidence of knowledge spillovers from ICT innovators to AI innovators, but this effect is confined to the frontier firms of the new technological field. Our findings suggest that, with the take-off of the new technology, the technological lead of top AI innovators has increased due to the accumulation of internal competences and the expanding knowledge base. These trends help explain the concentration process of the world\u2019s data market.",

At the same time, best practice in other fields, e.g. the amelioration of poverty or the teaching of reading, writing, or math, has improved more slowly, if at all. As Richard Nelson and colleagues have argued, it seems that practice and technology (\u201cknow-how\u201d) can only improve rapidly under rather special conditions: that, at any given point in time, some fields are more \u201cprogressible\u201d than others. Drawing on Nelson's work and studies in the history, sociology, and economics of technology and innovation, I offer a conceptual framework articulating several characteristics of practice in a field that may facilitate rapid progress. These characteristics, while not fixed, tend to remain fairly stable for long periods of time. I argue that know-how can improve more quickly 1) when \u201cvicarious trial\u201d of variations in practice is feasible and useful; 2) when practice is formal and standardized; 3) when practice is in significant part performed by artifacts rather than by humans; 4) when outcomes of variations in practice may be rapidly evaluated; 5) when valued performance dimensions are consistently agreed upon; 6) when contexts and objects of practice may be treated as, or have been made, consistent for the purposes of intervention; and 7) when labor is finely divided. Thus, analysis of these features may inform judgments about the plausibility of rapid advance within a field, absent disruptive change in methods or problem formulation. The argument may also shed light on which varieties of innovative effort may and may not foreseeably contribute to improving practice in a given field.",

Using a difference\u2013in\u2013difference approach on matched patents in the semiconductor industry in 1981\u20132010, we find that mobile scientists' patents receive more citations from rival firms after the mobility vis-\u00e0-vis before the mobility and vis-\u00e0-vis other similar patents. We conclude that rival firms respond to mobilities across other firms by attributing more attention to mobile scientists. Furthermore, the context of the mobility can determine the extent of response from rival firms. Rival firms are more likely to build on a mobile scientist's patents after mobility when the mobility occurs between technologically distant firms, the source firm or the hiring firm has low research experience, or the mobile scientist has considerable experience.",

We therefore conducted a qualitative inductive study comprising 68 interviews with academics who had engaged in two forms of activities\u2014knowledge transfer and co-creation. Whereas the entrepreneurship literature offers a resource-based argument, we made an original contribution to the literature by introducing an engagement-based argument in order to offer a more accurate prediction of the motivations and decision-making approaches of academics engaged in knowledge transfer and co-creation activities. We found that when the resource- and engagement-based arguments offer different predictions of the interplay between the motivations and decision-making approaches adopted, the cognitive proximity between academics and business researchers, which reflects whether the partners are from the same/different disciplines, resolves the puzzle. We captured these situational contingencies by developing six propositions that indicate how the engagement- and resource-based arguments jointly offer a more comprehensive explanation of the interplay. We discuss the implications of our findings with regard to how universities could offer customized training, rewards, and support structures based on the four types of interplay between the motivation and decision-making approaches.",

Linking accelerators' design to the known barriers to female entrepreneurship, we examined how accelerators may enhance female entrepreneurship by addressing their specific needs. Based on a dataset (N = 779) of structured interviews with startup founders who participated in accelerator programs in Israel during 2011\u20132019, we present evidence that female founders seek and gain more entrepreneurial knowledge, network building, and entrepreneurial self-efficacy during their participation in accelerators than do male founders. Female founders also seek to increase their legitimacy more than do their male counterparts but did not report making more progress in this aspect. Finally, both the goal of and progress in obtaining access to capital and improving fundraising skills received lower ratings from female founders than from male founders. We further ask whether accelerators are more helpful for women because they are better adapted to the female gender or because they are generally better adapted to founders with those background conditions that often characterize women. We found that the startup's stage of development and the founder's prior entrepreneurial experience mediated most gender differences, supporting the latter possibility. We discuss the implications of our findings for accelerators and other support programs as a means of increasing women's participation rates in innovative entrepreneurship.",

Our account delineates the key role that actors play in shaping the identity of a niche, amplifying its presence, and finally mainstreaming it. We observe a heterogenous response by incumbents to the emergent niche and highlight the sustained coexistence of a niche and regime as a distinct form of technological transition. Finally, we demonstrate the significant impact that a niche can have, spanning beyond the targeted regime, and becoming part of the landscape.

Several of the PPI implementation challenges reported in prior research originate in the institutional architecture underpinning demand articulation, and innovation procurement and adoption processes. We conceptualise innovation intermediaries as institutional entrepreneurs who seek to create new institutions or adjust existing ones to support PPI implementation. We report the results of two case studies of intermediaries facilitating PPI in the UK defence and health sectors, respectively. We contribute to PPI intermediation literature by showing that intermediaries address prevalent institutional failures through four types of institutional entrepreneurship activities: boundary spanning; advocacy; design of change; and capacity building. We elucidate, in particular, the role of individuals within intermediaries, as agents who learn about failures and adapt their institutional work over time. In doing so, these managers go beyond the remit and goals of the organisations they represent. The findings add to our understanding of how intermediaries support demand articulation for PPI by showing that their institutional work is also aimed at designing generic methods and processes to improve what is asked for, and how. We furthermore reveal conditions influencing the effectiveness of intermediaries' efforts to realise institutional change, thereby extending research on institutional entrepreneurship in PPI settings.",

Benefit-sharing agreements comprise a core element of ABS and are intended to leverage greater social and economic justice, create incentives for biodiversity conservation, and strengthen the rights of indigenous and local communities. However, emerging evidence suggests otherwise. Through review of four cases of biodiversity commercialization in South Africa \u2013 Hoodia gordonii, Aspalathus linearis (rooibos), Sceletium tortuosum (kougoed) and Pelargonium sidoides, each with histories of biopiracy charges and associated benefit-sharing agreements, this paper aims to explain this apparent contradiction. The cases reveal that while ABS has succeeded in recognizing holders of traditional knowledge, the wider political and economic struggles faced by communities remain neglected. Power relations and economic disparities have not changed, and control remains vested in land, with ownership remaining highly skewed towards industry partners who have market dominance; and intellectual property, the benefits of which are disassociated from traditional knowledge holders and biodiversity custodians. ABS processes have also led to a clamor for representation, favoring groups that are politically connected, well organized and resourced, while excluding more marginalized groups who are less capacitated. Moreover, despite significant biodiversity concerns in each case, there are few conservation benefits. Such trends, combined with new forms of \u201cdigital biopiracy\u201d and opportunities opening through the post 2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, emphasize the need to reconceptualize ABS to leverage more equitable and sustainable outcomes.",

Such a shift in policy theory should, ideally, be reflected in policy evaluation, but the literature has so far provided little advice on how to address TIP-related evaluation challenges such as directionality and system-level behavioural additionality. This paper discusses how the evaluation of policy interventions targeting system innovation can be designed to address these challenges. Combining the literature on sustainability transitions with policy evaluation, we propose an integrated evaluation framework composed of three main components: (i) programme theory (programme goals, systems boundaries and desired (or accepted) development paths); (ii) system analysis (transformative outcomes); and (iii) synthesis and overall assessment (including revision of programme theory). By integrating the two sets of literature, we provide a bridge between academic research on transitions and current evaluation practices. We briefly illustrate the applicability of the integrated framework in the BioInnovation Strategic Innovation Programme in Sweden.",

In fact, firms may have different market shares depending on the category under consideration, and technological discontinuities can be product category related. We extend the literature on windows of opportunity and changes in market leadership by showing that the chance a challenger has to reduce the market share gap with the market leader in a product category during a technological window depends on (a) whether the market leader in the focal product category is also the market leader in other product categories, (b) the share of a challenger's business in the focal product category relative to its overall business in the industry, and (c) the relative size of the product category with respect to the other product categories in the industry. We contend that such across-category factors influence the leaders and challengers' propensity to exploit opportunities resulting from technological discontinuities in a product category. We test a set of hypotheses using data on 31 mobile phone makers competing in India from 2003 to 2020 in the feature phone and smartphone product categories.",

We estimate the relative contribution of different approaches to seed innovation on soy performance over that period. We show how previous analyses have ignored the performance gains from plant breeding or misattributed them to genetic engineering. In our disaggregated assessment, seed innovations based on breeding techniques provide just as plausible an explanation for the expansion and performance gains of soy production. We illustrate how policy support to the seed industry is consistent with and is justified by mainstream narratives about the central role played by plant genetic engineering technology, and how the asymmetries created by these policy responses are contributing to the crowding out of plant breeding. This evidence, in our view, illustrates an important cognitive mechanism of lock-in to what may be a sub-optimal technology.",

Based on a county-industry level panel from 1998 to 2007 in China, we find that industrial clusters significantly increase local industries' productivity by lifting the average firm productivity and reallocating resources from less to more productive firms. Moreover, we find major mechanisms through which resource reallocation is improved within clusters: (i) clusters are associated with a higher firm turnover with increased entry and exit rates simultaneously; and (ii) within clusters' environment, the dispersion of individual firm's markup is significantly reduced, indicating intensified local competition within clusters. Such results suggest that industrial clusters in China help improve regional productivity and resource allocation efficiency with intensified competition and accelerated firm dynamics. The identification issues are carefully addressed by two-stage estimations with instrumental variables and other robustness checks.",

In this paper, we explore the effect of eco-innovation and climate governance on corporate commitment to climate change. We develop a unique measure for climate change commitment by considering four components, viz. whether a company supports the Sustainable Development Goal 13 on climate action, whether a company is aware that climate change can represent commercial risks or opportunities, whether a company reports Scope 3 CO2 emissions and whether a company sets a target for emission reduction. We measure eco-innovation by using a score collected from the Eikon database that reflects a company's capacity to reduce environmental costs, eco-innovation intensity measured as environmental expenditures over revenues. We also create an index computed as a composite score by totalling five eco-innovation proxies collected from the Eikon database that reflect companies' efforts to reduce environmental impact. Concerning climate governance, we focus on three proxies, namely the existence of an environmental committee, climate incentives and the existence of sustainability reports. Based on a sample of companies listed on the London Stock Exchange for the period of 2014\u20132020, we find that corporate eco-innovation is positively associated with climate change commitment. We argue that firms that adopt innovative approaches to efficiently control pollution and resource use and reduce their environmental impact are more committed to climate change. We also find that climate governance is positively associated with climate change commitment. We claim that companies that integrate climate change issues in governance can help address climate change risks and opportunities. Our empirical evidence provides recommendations for managers and policymakers to promote the adoption of eco-innovative technologies and integrate climate change issues in governance, which can contribute to corporate commitment to climate change.",

At the same time, the \u201cdeath of distance\u201d has been greatly exaggerated, especially in fields such as academic scholarship and knowledge development where the positive benefits of knowledge spillovers remain highly distance dependent. We analyze 17.6 million publications authored by 1.7 million scholars to examine how knowledge spillovers between scholars collaborating at different geographical distances impacts their future knowledge portfolios. Our results show that in 1975, scholars collaborating locally were 57 % more likely to learn from knowledge spillovers than similar scholars collaborating non-locally. We identify four factors that structure these findings. Individuals deriving the greatest learning premiums from local collaboration tend to be (1) in earlier stages of their career; (2) associated with lower-ranked institutions; (3) working with fewer collaborators; and (4) in STEM fields. The probability of learning drops with geographical distance and correspond to the number of institutional boundaries crossed during collaboration. We conclude that even in the 21st century, geographical distance still negatively impacts knowledge spillovers through collaboration. These findings have implications for debates in innovation and management studies concerning knowledge spillovers, the spatial organization of (knowledge-intensive) economic activity, regional innovation policies, structuring team-work and working-from-home vs. returning to office.",

We provide evidence that higher EHC among employees is associated with significantly higher levels of firm productivity. The baseline result implies that a 10 % increase in employees being former entrepreneurs increases firm-level productivity by 3.9 %. Additionally, we provide evidence that heterogeneity in employees' previous entrepreneurial experience (e.g., the reason for entering and exiting entrepreneurship, type of venture, length of entrepreneurial experiences, and relatedness of technology) influences the impact of EHC on productivity. The results are shown to be robust to various estimation techniques, alternative definitions of EHC, and other performance measures.",

We estimate the knowledge production function for US firms and find instead that knowledge production is increasing in the knowledge stock. This is reinforced by the observations that maximum research productivity across firms is increasing over time, and that research productivity year effects continue to exhibit decline after modeling contributions from knowledge and research labor. Given that fishing out appears unable to explain the decline in research productivity, we offer preliminary evidence of contingent factors that might contribute to the decline.",

Drawing on a practice-based study of the field of synthetic biology, the paper uses ethnographic, interview and survey data to offer a sociomaterial and relational perspective of technological change. As automation and digitalisation are deployed in research settings, our results show the emergence and persistence of what we call \u2018mundane knowledge work\u2019, including practices of checking, sharing and standardising data; and preparing, repairing and supervising laboratory robots. While these are subsidiary practices that are often invisible in comparison to scientific outputs used to measure performance, we find that mundane knowledge work constitutes a fundamental part of automated and digitalised biosciences, shaping scientists' working time and responsibilities. Contrary to expectations of the removal of such work by automation and digitalisation, we show that mundane work around data and robots persists through \u2018amplification\u2019 and \u2018diversification\u2019 processes. We argue that the persistence of mundane knowledge work suggests a digitalisation paradox in the context of everyday labour: while robotics and advanced data analytics aim at simplifying work processes, they also contribute to increasing their complexity in terms of number and diversity of tasks in creative, knowledge-intensive professions.",

Although the effects of complementary investments and their spillovers are often mentioned in the literature, there is a lack of in-depth research. This study aims to fill this gap, taking into account knowledge diffusion and complementarities between different intangible assets, and evaluating their effects on productivity. We propose new measures of knowledge, which consider these complementarities, by using principal component analysis (PCA) to aggregate intangibles, and the Niche overlap index to ease interpretation. The analysis is conducted on an unbalanced country-industry panel dataset of 13 European countries, constructed from a combination of sources such as INTAN-Invest, WIOD, World Bank and EU-KLEMS. We develop total factor productivity proxies, and estimate the effects of knowledge diffusion on productivity by means of GMM panel regressions. Results confirm the importance of considering complementarities for detecting knowledge spillover effects, especially in the case of domestic spillovers, while foreign spillovers are shown to be less effective, supporting the view of knowledge spillovers as a prevalently localised phenomenon.",

When the WTO adopted a permissive regulatory environment, we find that the Korean government increased R&D subsidies significantly (89.21%) and selectively so for firms and industries with higher returns. Recipient firms conducted less basic research and more development research. Improvements in innovations were mostly incremental and minor. However, such changes did not persist once the WTO switched to a restrictive regulatory environment. Our findings show that the regulatory environment imposed by the WTO largely affects allocation of R&D subsidies and suggest that a permissive regulatory environment may not necessarily maximize the potential for breakthrough innovations.",

We reveal how this relationship is contingent upon the density of both the focal industry and the industries that are mutually connected to the cause of the movement, as well as the concentration of generalist firms. We demonstrate how larger social movements act in a compensatory role to elicit entry when ecological conditions are least favorable to entry. By uncovering the conditional influence of movements, we contribute to theory at the intersection of social movements and entrepreneurship.",

This framework integrates econometric analysis and a technology foresight procedure to predict: (i) the most COVID-19 resilient industries at the national level; and (ii) the most adversely affected industries (due to prior investment in innovation) that requires public support. Our econometric results show that the pandemic has induced a \u2018double-edge sword\u2019 effect of innovation on firm\u2019s COVID-19 adaptable capacity (CAC). Costly innovation undertaken before the pandemic can be bad for firms if it compounds the problem of declining post-pandemic outbreak profit and optimism. Contrarily, firm level innovation improves firm\u2019s CAC as the prior innovators\u2019 profitability are found to have above-even odds of rebounding quickly post-pandemic outbreak. Our empirical analysis focuses mostly on developing economies, where firms are most likely implementing only incremental (non-frontier) innovation and thus our results should be generalized with caution.",

We identify two moderators of prisms, other scientists' quality uncertainty and awareness of the collaboration, and link prisms to \u201csleeping beauties\u201d, articles that are initially overlooked and then rediscovered later. Empirically, we examine the effect on citations of collaborating with a star who either won, or \u2013 serving as the control group \u2013 who was nominated for but did not win, the Nobel Prize in Physics. We find that articles by the winners' coauthors (and which were published prior to the focal coauthor's first collaboration with the winner) receive a citation boost after the Nobel Prize is awarded, relative to articles by the coauthors of nominees, and that awareness and quality uncertainty moderate this effect. We further find that this difference in citations causes sleeping beauties written by the coauthors of Nobel Prize winners to be rediscovered faster. Our results clarify how star scientists' indirect peer effects impact their coauthors and, through sleeping beauties, how prisms matter for science more broadly.",

We argue that the urban agglomeration of economic agents within a country has an inverted U-shaped relationship with new ventures' innovativeness, suggesting that both insufficient and excessive agglomeration might be detrimental to entrepreneurial innovativeness. Additionally, we perform interactions between individual level factors and urban agglomeration to examine the differential effects of entrepreneurs' internal resources and capabilities. Results confirm our hypothesising that the geographical concentration of economic agents within a country exerts an inverted U-shaped influence on new ventures' innovativeness. Furthermore, we find that entrepreneurs with higher levels of education or prior entrepreneurial experience are better equipped to benefit from agglomeration and to mitigate its negative effects; in contrast, at low levels of agglomeration, entrepreneurs with lower resources exhibit increasing marginal returns. Entrepreneurs in contact with other entrepreneurs are better positioned to deal with agglomeration externalities although their benefits and drawbacks are intensified. Our research contributes to the understanding of agglomeration externalities and entrepreneurial innovativeness, its non-linear dynamics and differential effects.",

Adopting OI in such a secretive environment unlocks new possibilities to analyze how firms can pursue openness and secrecy. This article builds on a qualitative research conducted inside a large military firm that has implemented an inbound OI strategy. Relying on multiple case studies and interviews with individual players involved in the firm's OI initiatives, we analyzed how these players deploy secrecy practices when participating to OI projects. They actually combine cognitive practices (aiming at modulating the contextual depth of the knowledge revealed through reframing) with relational practices (aiming at controlling the visibility and exposure of this knowledge). We highlight how these combinations evolve during the lifecycle of OI partnerships. By emphasizing different modes by which individual actors practice secrecy in OI, we contribute to previous research addressing how organizations navigate the paradox of openness. Besides, this study proposes new theoretical insights on the role and features of secrecy practices in innovation activities, and thus contributes to the emerging research field of managerial secrecy.",

Little is known, however, about preferences of the latter except in the form of qualitative social attitudes survey. We suggest that understanding taxpayers' preferences in the form of their willingness to pay (a money metric) for fundamental science is feasible and informative. We have designed a contingent valuation (CV) experiment about public support of science as reflected in the preferences of Swiss taxpayers for particle physics research at CERN, the laboratory where the Higgs boson has been discovered in 2012. Differently from a previous study on the attitudes of French citizens, in this paper we propose a novel methodological framework by a dual repeated bidding mechanism where sub-samples of respondents are respectively given/not given the information on the implicit tax they already pay to support CERN in the first place. We find clear convergence of results between the groups and discuss why such a finding has policy and methodological implications for research on government funding of basic research. We compare findings in Switzerland and France. The experiment is replicable in different countries and scientific fields and opens the way to a new empirical research avenue on the public support to science.",

Using municipal data, we compare the effect of exposure to fake news on the vote for populist parties in the 2013 and 2018 elections. To do so, we introduce a novel indicator of populism using text mining on the Facebook posts of Italian parties before the elections. Our findings support the view that exposure to fake news favours populist parties regardless of prior support for populist parties, but also that fake news alone cannot explain most of the growth in populism.",

Cognitive processes show aging-related increases in experience-based knowledge (pragmatics or crystallized abilities) and decreases in the ability to process novel information quickly and efficiently (mechanics or fluid abilities). We explore the role of these age-related changes in the invention process, using a new database created by combining the publicly available patent data with information on inventor ages scraped from directory websites for approximately 1.2 million U.S.-resident inventors patenting between 1976 and 2017. We have made these data publicly available on the Harvard Dataverse and full documentation can be found in Kaltenberg et al. (2021) In the current paper, we present some descriptive statistics, and explore changing patterns of invention as inventor's age. For solo inventors, backward citations and originality increase with age, consistent with their being connected to crystallized intelligence. Forward citations, number of claims, and generality measures, as well as a citation-based measure of disruptiveness decline with inventor age, consistent with a connection to fluid intelligence. A similar pattern was found for performance in teams based on the average age of inventors in the team. Exploration of age diversity showed that teams with a wider age range had patents that are slightly more important (i.e., with more forward citations). Merging of these new data with other data that capture diverse aspects of inventors' environment and incentives offers rich potential for new research on invention.",

On the African continent, progress in scientific production and integration has remained limited, mostly led by a global or international agenda, and bound to a few top publishing nations. The high-level policy commitments and the accumulated policies and strategies developed and pursued under the various intertwined sub-regional economic groupings have, to date, only diversely contributed to policy alignment and coordination in the area of science, technology, and innovation (STI) across Africa. In this context, this paper provides a first and hence original assessment of the role of region-specific factors in shaping scientific collaboration on the continent. For this purpose, our study builds upon the proximity approach to analyse the determinants of scientific collaboration between African countries, using co-publications data from Thomson Reuters' Web of Science database as a proxy of such collaboration. Our results suggest that the majority of African regional economic communities (RECs) have not yet had a significant effect on scientific co-publication. Nevertheless, some important region-specific factors do seem to be at play, such as a shared ethnical language, membership in the African and Malagasy Council for Higher Education (CAMES), and the presence of a common European partner as a third partner in co-publication. Existing policies aimed at the development of an Africa-wide research area should aim to leverage existing and emerging regional excellence networks and novel coordination models to accelerate the process of scientific integration in Africa.",

Using machine learning techniques to uniquely identify inventors across patents, we are able to track the migration patterns of nearly one million individual inventors across countries. Migrant inventors account for more than nine percent of inventors in our sample. The econometric analysis seeks to explain the recurring finding in the literature that migrant inventors are more productive than non-migrant inventors. We find evidence that migrant inventors become about twenty-three percent more productive after having migrated. The disambiguated inventor data are openly available.",

Focusing on the Indian pharmaceutical market, we use a natural experiment involving a publication that identified a pathogenic outbreak involving a carbapenem antibiotic resistant superbug. Consistent with theory, we find that this upstream research shock caused multinational firms selling carbapenem antibiotics in India to reduce their downstream market exposure. Rational antibiotic stewardship implies that we should observe a similar response by domestic Indian firms. Surprisingly, we observe the opposite, domestic Indian firms filled the void in the market left by multinational firms. We confirm this aggregate finding with prescription level data; Indian physicians prescribed fewer focal multinational products relative to domestic firm products. Results are robust to alternate control groups and placebo testing. Implications for antibiotic resistance, global health policy and innovation policy are discussed.",

By explicitly connecting international trade with innovation and economic competitiveness, we fill a gap in the literature on the sustainable energy transition.

Second, the more balanced and comprehensive the domestic policy mix, the higher the export capacity.

The decomposition of this innovation-related wage premium suggests that it is larger for workers in manufacturing, although also positive and significant for those in agriculture and services; and larger for large firms. More importantly, the paper explores the causality between innovation and wages. First, we find some empirical support for \u201cself-selection\u201d \u2014 firms that innovate already pay higher wages before becoming innovators. Second, we find strong evidence of wage increases associated with starting innovation activity, which are persistent for three years after firms start innovating.

Yet the last decade has witnessed a substantial degree of decertification behavior, as organizations have increasingly decided to voluntarily withdraw from quality-management standards by not recertifying. While the drivers of the decision to initially adopt quality-management standards have been extensively studied, the drivers of the decision to decertify have received scant scholarly attention. We argue that innovative organizations are generally prone to retaining quality-management certification and thus exhibit a tendency to not abandon certification; however, radically-innovative organizations are more prone than incrementally-innovative organizations to discontinue quality-management standards and thereby exhibit a tendency to withdraw from quality certification. We compile World Bank data surveying facilities based in 50 countries and 103 industrial sectors across the 2003 to 2017 period. Taking advantage of the data's panel properties yields a dataset composed of up to 1755 facility-level observations of recertification decisions for empirical analysis. Our empirical testing employs a probit estimation technique that accounts for the appropriate fixed effects and generates results that support our theoretical priors regarding decertification behavior.",

In this study, I investigate what happens to the knowledge of star inventors following their absence. In particular, I consider the composition of stars' ties with coinventors and examine how it affects the future use of stars' knowledge (i.e., patents). Using the death of star inventors as an exogenous cause for their absence in firms, I find that the use of a star's patents in a firm's subsequent inventive efforts declines following the star's death. The results also indicate that when star inventors frequently collaborate with coinventors, the negative effect of stars' absence on the future use of their knowledge is somewhat alleviated. Further, the presence of central inventors in stars' collaboration networks increases the relative use of stars' knowledge in future inventions. The findings inform managers about conditions that favor \u201cpassing the torch\u201d of knowledge from stars to their peers.",

After confirming that large firms indeed produce more valuable inventions, we consider two possible sources: a superior ability to invent, or a superior ability to extract value from their inventions. We develop a simple model that discriminates between the two explanations. Using a sample of 2,786 public corporations, and measures of both patent quality and patent value, we find that, while average invention value rises with size, average invention quality declines, suggesting, per our model, that the large firm advantage is not due to superior inventive capability, but due to the superior ability to extract value. We provide evidence suggesting that this superior ability to extract value is due to the greater commercialization capabilities of larger firms.",

We describe an approach that uses data from online job ads to rank emerging technologies on their GPT likelihood. The approach suggests which technologies are likely to have a broader economic impact, and which are likely to remain useful but narrower enabling technologies. Our approach has at least 5 years predictive power distinct from prevailing patent-based methods of identifying GPTs. We apply our approach to 21 different emerging technologies, and find that a cluster of technologies comprised of machine learning and related data science technologies is relatively likely to be a GPT.",

This regulation mandates firms with pre-tax profits above a certain threshold to spend 2 % of the profits on CSR. We demonstrate a significant bunching of companies just below the profit threshold post-regulation compared to the pre-regulation period. Firms close to the profit threshold manipulate their earnings to avoid compliance by increasing their R&D expenses. We show that, on average, firms that increase R&D expenses to avoid the regulation apply for one more patent and announce two new products. The increase in R&D expenses and patenting is concentrated in firms with a prior history of innovation. Our results suggest that social policies can generate indirect incentives for innovation.",

However, many Chinese organizations experience, similar to other latecomers to standardization, limited success when contributing to standardization processes, a phenomenon also referred to as the standardization gap. The literature on standardization to date has paid little attention to how Chinese latecomers enter and influence international standardization processes that have traditionally been shaped by organizations from industrialized countries. We therefore analyze the country-of-origin effect as well as factors such as experience and collaboration for successful contributions of Chinese organizations to standards. Using data from the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and binary logistic regression analysis, we are able to show that, in our sample, contributions from Chinese latecomers are significantly less likely to be accepted than those from more established actors from industrialized economies. Moreover, our findings indicate that experience is closely associated with success in international ICT standardization, but not moderated by national origin. Therefore, Chinese latecomers might not be able to catch up if they move at the same pace as established competitors. They need to find a way to leapfrog extensive development steps, narrow the standardization capability gap, and thus strengthen their participation and influence. One way to do so might be through strategic collaboration, as our results suggest that Chinese organizations benefit more from collaborating with organizations from more established regions than vice versa, on which we call for further research to establish the causal mechanisms.",

However, current empirical evidence suggests that research and development (R&D) expenditures and patenting are procyclical, not countercyclical. In this paper, we introduce new insights to enrich this debate. First, using panel data on the quality of innovation between 1980 and 2019, we document that the quality of innovation is countercyclical: Innovations produced during busts have a larger effect on the path of future research than those developed during booms. Second, we investigate several additional patterns on the composition of R&D. We find that the procyclicality of R&D is concentrated among firms that are more financially constrained, and that time allocated towards basic science (applied) research is countercyclical (procyclical). These results highlight the importance of composition effects among not only the organizations that contribute to innovation over the business cycle, but also the tasks that employees within these organizations perform.",

We show that within-occupation reorientation away from routine tasks: i) accounts for 1/3 of the decline in routine-task use; ii) accelerated in the 1990s, decelerated in the 2000s but with significant convergence across occupations; and iii) allowed workers to escape the employment and wage decline, conditional on the initial level of routine-task intensity. The latter finding suggests that task reorientation is a key channel through which labour markets adapt to various forms of labour-saving technological change.",

This paper fills this gap using novel data on a set of highly talented teenagers\u2014 participants in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO)\u2014and presents three results. First, migrants to the U.S. are up to six times more productive than migrants to other countries, even after accounting for talent during one's teenage years. Second, most of the productivity difference is associated with academics being more productive in the U.S. compared to those who stay home (with differences in entry rates into academia mattering less). Third, there is a large gap between aspirations to move to the U.S. and actual migration: about 2 in 3 of the world's most talented youth from developing countries would like to migrate to the U.S. for their undergraduate studies, but only 1 in 4 do, with financing constraints being a key barrier. A back of the envelope calculation suggests that removing constraints on immigration could increase the global scientific output of future cohorts by up to 50 %.",

We use rich data for three Small Open Economies (Ireland, Denmark, and New Zealand) on publications, citations and co-authorships to examine how co-authorship with a co-located star scientist affects the co-author's productivity, both including and excluding the output directly co-authored with the star. The latter effect provides a measure of the extent to which star collaborations crowd out/in other output. Event-study analyses reveal that star co-authorships are associated with economically and statistically significant increases in co-authors' output (measured by field-normalized total citations). Output in the three years after the initial star co-authorship is increased by 89.6 % when star co-authored publications are included and by 16.2 % when they are excluded. The results are robust to using an alternative measure of quality-adjusted output based on journal publication quality. We find co-authoring with a star increases the quality but not quantity of output when star co-authored publications are excluded. We explore heterogeneity by period, field and whether the authors have multiple star co-authorships. We conclude that policymakers' and institutions' efforts to promote access to star scientists may have substantial direct and indirect effects on the productivity of incumbent scientists within departments.",

Using unique data for a population of University of California spinoffs, we find pronounced differences between companies commercializing digital technologies (software and hardware), and those that focus on other product spaces. For digital spinoffs, receiving an SBIR award has a negative impact on raising venture capital and no impact on IPOs, exits or first sales. Conversely, for non-digital firms (e.g., biotechnology, energy), receiving an SBIR award has a positive effect on raising venture capital and performance outcomes. We reason that digital technologies are subject to faster cycle times and higher market uncertainty, relative to technological uncertainty. Digital firms may therefore benefit less from subsidies designed to support technology development, and private investors may view the need of digital companies to obtain such subsidies as a negative certification. Our findings inform policy by suggesting that the industrial domain may be an important boundary condition for the effectiveness of SBIR-type subsidies for university spinoffs.",

Data from SSO intellectual property disclosures have been used in academic studies to provide a window into the standard setting process, and in legal proceedings to assess the relative contribution of different parties to a standard. We describe the disclosure process, discuss the link between SSO rules and patent-holder incentives, and analyze disclosure practices using a novel dataset constructed from the disclosure archives of thirteen major SSOs. Our empirical results suggest that subtle differences in SSO policies influence which patents are disclosed, the terms of licensing commitments, and ultimately long-run citation and litigation rates for the underlying patents. Thus, while policy debates sometimes characterize SSOs as a relatively homogeneous set of institutions, our results point in the opposite direction \u2013 towards the importance of recognizing heterogeneity in SSO policies and practices.",

Recognizing these benefits, policies that encourage business angels to invest in start-ups are very popular across countries. We use a natural experiment setting to examine the effect of such a policy on the number of angels investing in each start-up targeted by the incentivizing policy. Using data on 6840 Israeli start-ups in seven high-tech industries with 9095 angels, we find that a policy encouraging angels to invest in seed-stage start-ups effectively reduced the number of angels investing in each firm. Evidence suggests that the investments by angels in these start-ups also decreased compared to what would have been expected in the absence of the incentive policy. Interviews we conducted with angels shed some light on potential reasons for the decline. We discuss potential policy implications.",

Thus, several equity crowdfunding platforms have started considering the development of secondary markets for buying and selling shares. Using detailed data from the world's first secondary market for equity crowdfunding, we investigate whether plans to list on the secondary market increase investor participation and thus the amount of money entrepreneurs raise during their equity crowdfunding campaigns. We find that in the early days of the secondary market, communicating a listing plan attracted more investors and larger investment sums. However, these effects largely disappeared after the first two years of secondary market operation. We interpret this to stem from investors' recognition of the insufficient liquidity of the secondary market and thus its probable inability to constitute a viable exit route. We also find that ex post, many entrepreneurs forgo listing, especially if their campaigns are not sufficiently successful, which implies significant costs associated with a listing. Our findings offer valuable insights to platforms aiming at launching secondary markets and regulators responsible for validating relevant initiatives. Specifically, we highlight how participation in equity ownership can be increased through well-functioning secondary markets, which however are difficult to achieve within equity crowdfunding.",

However, there are n-player games, such as Salop's circle model, that seem intuitively to look the same to all players, but do not meet the common definition of a symmetric n-player game. This paper proposes a more general symmetry condition that is satisfied by such models. Previous authors have established that games which are symmetric in the common sense have a number of useful properties relating to equilibrium characterization and comparative statics. With few exceptions, those properties continue to hold in the richer class of games that meet the symmetry condition proposed here.",

Deception is costly to Sender and the cost is endogenous: it is increasing in the distance between the induced belief and the belief that should have been induced. A message function that induces Sender to engage in deception is not credible and cannot be part of an equilibrium. We study credible communication with state-dependent and state-independent Sender's preferences. The cost of deception parametrizes the sender's ability to commit to her strategy. Through varying this cost, our model spans the range from cheap talk, or no commitment (Crawford and Sobel, 1982) to full commitment (Kamenica and Gentzkow, 2011).",

I show that, with uncertain tolerance for delay, each equilibrium pledge maximizes an asymmetric Nash product. The weights on others' payoffs increase in the uncertainty, but decrease in the correlation of the shocks. The weights vary pledge to pledge, and this implies that the outcome is generically inefficient. The Nash demand game and its mapping to the Nash bargaining solution follow as a limiting case. The model sheds light on the Paris climate change agreement, but it also applies to negotiations between policymakers or business partners that have differentiated responsibilities or expertise.",

Second, we study basic properties of perfect pairwise stability: existence, admissibility and perturbation. We further show that our concept is distinct from the concept of strongly stable networks introduced by Jackson and Van den Nouweland (2005), and perfect Nash equilibria of the Myerson network formation game studied by Calv\u00f3-Armengol and \u0130lk\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 (2009).

Carroll (2015) showed that there exists a linear contract that is optimal within the class of deterministic contracts. This paper shows that, whenever there is an optimal linear contract with non-zero slope, the principal can strictly increase her payoff by randomizing over deterministic, linear contracts. Hence, if the principal believes that randomization can alleviate her ambiguity aversion, then restricting attention to the study of deterministic contracts is with loss of generality.",

We consider a setting with social learning, where consumers observe sales from previous cohorts and update beliefs about product quality before making their purchase. Imposing a capacity constraint directly limits sales but also makes information coarser for consumers, who react favourably to a sell-out because they infer only that demand must exceed capacity. Consumer learning is then limited even with large cohorts and unbounded private signals, because the firm acts strategically to influence the consumers' learning environment. Our results suggest that in suitable environments capacity constraints can serve as a useful tool to implement optimal information design in practice: if private signals are not too precise and capacity can be changed over time, then in large markets the firm's optimal choice of capacity delivers the same expected sales as the Bayesian persuasion solution.",

Equilibrium distancing flattens the curve and decreases the final size of the epidemic. We examine the effects of distancing on the outset, the peak, and the final size of the epidemic. First, the prevalence increases beyond the initial value only if the transmission rate is in the intermediate region. Second, the peak of the epidemic is non-monotonic in the transmission rate. A reduction in the transmission rate can increase the peak. However, a decrease in the cost of distancing always flattens the curve. Third, both a reduction in the transmission rate as well as a reduction in the cost of distancing decrease the final size of the epidemic. Our results suggest that public policies that decrease the transmission rate can lead to unintended negative consequences in the short run but not in the long run. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between interventions that affect the transmission rate and interventions that affect contact rates.",

We investigate how the qualitative features of an epidemic's Nash-equilibrium trajectory depend on the nature of the economic benefits that people get from activity. If economic benefits do not depend on how many others are active, as usually modeled, then there is a unique equilibrium trajectory, the epidemic eventually reaches a steady state, and agents born into the steady state have zero expected lifetime welfare. On the other hand, if the benefit of activity increases as others are more active (\u201csocial benefits\u201d) and the disease is sufficiently severe, then there are always multiple equilibrium trajectories, including some that never settle into a steady state and that welfare dominate any given steady-state equilibrium. Within this framework, we analyze the equilibrium impact of a policy that modestly reduces the transmission rate. Such a policy has no long-run effect on society-wide welfare absent social benefits, but can raise long-run welfare if there are social benefits and the epidemic never settles into a steady state.",

Our optimal information structure exhibits local obfuscation: some agents receive a signal matching the regime's true strength, and others receive an elevated signal professing slightly higher strength. This policy is the unique limit of finite-signal problems. Public signals are strictly suboptimal, and in some cases where public signals become futile, local obfuscation guarantees the collapse of agents' coordination, making the designer's information disclosure time consistent and relieving the usual commitment concern.",

We characterize transaction prices as a function of the endogenous evolution of the market composition and economic conditions, providing several novel comparative statics results.

To address this question, we define an efficient temporary equilibrium (ETE) within the framework of a two period economy. Although an ETE allocation is intertemporally efficient and is obtained by perfect competition, it can arise without the agents' forecasts being coordinated on a perfect foresight price. With time-separable utilities, we show that there is a one dimensional set of ETE allocations for generic endowments. Moreover, these efficient allocations can be supported by forecasts that disagree up to one degree of freedom. Thus, strong as efficiency and perfect competition may appear, they do not imply perfect foresight, but they do add explanatory power to temporary equilibrium, since they select a small subset out of the Pareto efficient allocations, which generally have higher dimension.",

I exploit cohort differences in exposure to equalization generated by state-level reforms. To address the endogeneity of postreform revenues due to household sorting after a reform, I use a simulated-instruments approach that uses newly collected data on states\u2019 funding formulas to simulate revenues without sorting. I find that equalization has a large effect on the mobility of low-income students. Reductions in input gaps between low-income and high-income districts are likely channels behind this effect.",

Endogenous segregation fueled by parents choosing schools on the basis of their racial compositions can in principle dwarf all other determinants of segregation over time because of social multiplier effects. However, we find that demographic change from Hispanic immigration has been the biggest driver of these trends. These findings are particularly pronounced in urban areas, which experienced the largest changes in segregation and are where policy makers are most concerned about the pernicious effects of segregation.",

This paper combines Mexican and US data to estimate a dynamic model of consumption, emigration, and remigration, accounting for financial constraints. An increase in Mexican household earnings shortens migration duration but raises the number of trips per migrant. For lower-income migrants, a rise in Mexican wages leads to a more than proportional effect on consumption expenditure in Mexico, arising from repatriated savings.",

The conventional explanation for such a negative correlation is that early marriage leads to earlier and higher fertility, which in turn prevents women from acquiring education. Here, we propose that early marriages enabled couples to overcome credit constraints in education. A model that includes this motive and mechanism can replicate not only the marriage and education patterns observed in the middle of the century in the United States but also the overall trends over the twentieth century.",

This article provides a systematic review of the relatively recent but already abundant literature on auctions for renewable energy and proposes a future research agenda on the topic. Major themes, gaps in knowledge, and trends in the literature are highlighted. More research efforts will be needed on the institutional capacity and arrangements, coordination between auctions and other procedures and appropriate inclusion of auctions in policy mixes. The trade-offs between different criteria should be the focus of more rigorous and quantitative marginal analysis, identifying the extent to which improving a given criterion worsens another. The existence, causes and consequences of underbidding, the implications of the just energy transition for the performance of auctions and auction design, the marginal impact of the level of design elements and the interactions between design element choices in \u201cdesign element packages\u201d merit more attention. There should be a greater focus on the micro-level in the assessment of the success of auctions and auction design. At a methodological level, assessments of auctions with case studies should coexist with more quantitative studies on the topic, using a wide range of methodologies. However, the transferability of lessons on the functioning of design elements across different contexts will be necessarily limited. Finally, a plea is made to national governments and international institutions to facilitate the access to auction data.",

This analysis uses market modelling to assess and compare the effectiveness of various measures to mitigate the gas \u2013 and by extension energy \u2013 price crisis in the short and longer term. First, the realization of the 5th PCI package adopted by the European Commission in November 2021 would significantly reduce EU prices, especially in the Eastern Member States that tend to be more dependent on the single external supplier. At the same time, the billions of euros that would be poured in risk becoming stranded assets in the long-term with tightening climate regulations. Secondly, uniform voluntary demand response has significant potential to reduce prices, especially in the Eastern Member States. Thirdly, the introduction of European strategic gas reserves can bring temporary price relief but is not a cost-efficient solution. However, security of supply considerations can outweigh the negative economic outcomes.",

Natural gas went from being the source of 7% of electricity in 1990 to 62.3% in 2020. A co-dependence of electricity and natural gas systems has been established and is increasing. Is this fact consistent with the objective of decarbonizing the electricity sector? We study this question through a decomposition analysis of electricity Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in Mexico between 1990 and 2015. We use a Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) to quantify the changes of electricity GHG emissions related to activity, carbon coefficient, structure, and energy intensity effects. Activity effect was the most significant driver of GHG emissions growth, structure and energy intensity effects contributed to limiting that growth, while the carbon coefficient effect had a small contribution to mitigating GHG emissions. From these results, we raise concerns about the role of natural gas, which crowd-out renewable energy and could lead to carbon lock-in and stranded assets in the long term. In addition, Mexico's energy system relies heavily on U.S. natural gas. In light of these concerns, we concluded that an energy policy aiming towards a low-carbon energy system should consider the composition \u201cnatural gas + renewable energies + energy efficiency\u201d.",

First, it establishes a five-level framework incorporating the dimensions: availability and diversity; affordability and equality; efficiency and reliability; regulation and governance; and environmental sustainability to conceptualize energy security. 18 metrics characterizing these dimensions are then used to assess the energy security performance of the UEMOA countries during the 2010\u20132019 period. The results indicate that C\u00f4te d'Ivoire was the most secure country of the Union, followed by Senegal and Togo in 2019, while the worst-performing country was Niger. Furthermore, Mali, Benin and Niger were found to have regressed the most concerning energy security from 2010 to 2019, whereas Senegal had improved greatest, followed by Togo, Cote d\u2019Ivoire and Burkina Faso. In addition, none of the countries were found to perform well in all the indicators of energy security. Therefore, common actions such as improving governance, increasing generation capacity with priority to renewable sources, improving energy efficiency, upgrading power systems and encouraging R&D and paying more attention to environmental concerns could enhance energy security throughout the electricity sectors of all the UEMOA countries.",

To face this problem, one replacement alternative, that also minimizes the use of fossil fuels, is the firewood electrification. That means, supplying the same heat requirements through electricity, taking advantage of the large adoption of renewable energy in Chile. However, since electricity is much more expensive than firewood, this solution may have significant costs. To determine those costs, heating consumption profiles were constructed for different thermal zones and socioeconomic level in the south of Chile (56% of the territory and 33% of the population). These profiles were transformed into electricity profiles, considering temperature vectors and efficiency curves of real heat pumps. Finally, based on residential tariffs, the additional household expenditure and the energy poverty levels were determined.",

Variant from the primary industry and the tertiary industry, the secondary industry (mainly the industrial sectors) is made up of numerous energy-intensive firms and hence, have critical impacts on the regional carbon intensity. However, there is little knowledge about the structure of the secondary industry's relocation and its impact on carbon intensity. Based on the latest multi-regional input-output (MRIO) table, this paper measures the scale, trend and structure of the secondary industry's relocation between eight regions in China. The effect of the secondary industry's relocation on regional carbon intensity is discussed by applying GMM techniques to the panel data on the interregional industrial relocation across 30 provinces. The results confirm that the inflow of secondary industry positively affects the carbon intensity, which is stronger in the central regions. In addition, the heterogeneity analysis shows that implementing the \u201cBelt and Road\u201d Initiative enhances the impact of the secondary industry's relocation on carbon intensity. This paper deepens the understanding of the environmental effects of industrial relocation.",

Citizen co-investment refers to the process by which members of the local community can financially participate in renewable energy projects prior to or shortly after construction. While previous research has often been cross-sectional and focused on the preferences of citizen-investors, this paper focuses on the perspective of project developers and asks why, when and how they offer citizens the opportunity to co-invest in wind farms. The work is based on the analysis of fourteen in-depth interviews with a sample of experienced German wind energy developers. The analysis shows that the decision to offer co-investment is driven by citizen demand and local stakeholder preferences, rather than financial needs. We shed light on how experienced developers deal with key trade-offs in terms of the timing of their offering and the choice of capital structure. As a result, we offer a number of testable propositions for further research on the nuanced relationship between citizen co-investment and social acceptance and derive recommendations for policymakers.",

To fill this gap, this paper measures the level of the digital economy in 227 Chinese cities from 2011 to 2019. The non-linear effect and mechanism of the digital economy on electricity intensity are investigated through the panel smooth transition model. This research finds that the digital economy promotes electricity intensity and this effect shows an inverted \"U\" shape. The correlation between the digital economy and electricity intensity has been consistently positive throughout the sample observation period. According to the findings, the digital economy increases electricity intensity by encouraging the development of infrastructure and the usage of electronic items while decreasing it by encouraging a change in consumption and technological advancement. This study provides new insights and enhances the understanding of correlation between the digital economy and electricity intensity.",

For both schemes, we develop a bilevel optimization model where the DSO, in the Upper Level, sets the flexibility price and network tariffs. Residential consumers react to those signals in the Lower Level. They can be prosumers that invest in solar PV and batteries or passive consumers. Two regulatory issues are investigated. First, which option to choose for regulators between mandatory and voluntary demand connection agreements. We find that mandatory demand-side connection agreements result in higher welfare gains compared to voluntary ones and a lower price for flexibility. However, such agreements may entail some implementation issues and different curtailment levels among consumers. This connects with the second investigated issue investigated on how to implement mandatory demand connection agreements from equity and feasibility perspectives. When introducing a pro-rata constrained mandatory scheme, curtailing consumers equally, we find that welfare levels are still higher than under the voluntary scheme but lower than in the unconstrained mandatory scheme.",

Dual Carbon strategy is a complex systematic work involving the whole society, particularly the energy system and water resources system, and cities play a key role in the strategy. Using LEAP-WEAP-Beijing model, this paper examines the pathways of carbon emissions reduction for 2020\u20132030 under the water-energy constraint in Beijing. It is found that Beijing has large potential to reduce carbon emissions, and that the deployment of local gas-fired power has the greatest emissions reduction effect. Nevertheless, it is not advisable to prioritize local gas-fired power as it would undermine the water resources security. Instead, renewable energy deployment and optimization of imported power structure should be prioritized. Further, it is not appropriate to eliminate conventional energy sources at an early stage as diversification of energy sources is the guarantee of energy security. On the energy consumption side, although electrification is recognized as an important measure to reduce emissions, it should be pushed forward in a stepwise way. Partial electrification is the optimal pathway in terms of both emissions reduction and energy security level. Building on these findings, specific recommendations to policy makers are provided.",

Consequently, different forms of residential energy consumption should have different impacts on energy poverty, when analysed for each degree of urbanisation. Verifying this was the underlying motivation for this study. Thus, it investigates how forms of residential energy consumption (oil, wood/biomass, natural gas, and electricity) impact energy poverty in (a) cities; (b) towns and suburbs; and (c) rural areas. To do so, data from 2005 until 2018 for twelve European countries was analysed using three-panel data sets, one for each urbanisation degree. The results, estimated using Feasible Generalised Least Squares, indicated that, in sparsely populated areas (towns, suburbs, and rural areas), primary energy sources, such as wood/biomass and natural gas alleviate energy poverty. Conversely, in cities, residential electricity consumption has been the key form for decreasing both poverty and energy poverty. The results of this research highlight that energy forms have differing impacts on energy poverty in areas with different levels of urbanisation. Therefore, energy policies should be planned at a disaggregated regional level within countries, and not at a national or European level.",

We examine how selective attention to media coverage of the impacts impact issue attitudes; the role of political ideology in driving such attention; and how this political divide emerges via selective attention to aforementioned content. We contribute to existing work on media attention antecedents and outcomes but with a hitherto unexplored focus on specific issue dimensions that have garnered media and public attention. We explore these relationships using U.S. national survey data (n = 700). We find that political ideology is not associated with attention to coverage of economic impacts, but such attention is predictive of higher UOGD support. Moreover, political ideology is associated with attention to coverage of environmental impacts (more conservative \u2192 less attention), and such attention predicts lower support. This indirect effect was also statistically meaningful. Overall, UOGD news media discourse (and attention thereto) has important energy policy implications.",

In order to identify the factors that most influence the acceptance/rejection of renewable electricity generation technologies (photovoltaic, wind and biomass) at a local level, in this study we conducted a structured survey of the population of the province of Ja\u00e9n in southern Spain. The analysis of the results of the questionnaire reveals that the social acceptance of RE plants is influenced by their location and size, and identifies the main criteria and situations that people take into consideration when deciding whether to support or reject RE projects. Although the results suggest that all RE technologies are widely accepted, they also highlight a preference for photovoltaic energy and for medium-sized plants in sites with low natural value. This article provides information and recommendations to facilitate the drafting of policies, plans and future studies that will enable social barriers to the implementation of RE technologies to be reduced, so helping accelerate the energy transition that is required in order for agreed climate targets to be met.",

Based on these strategies, we analyse which objectives lead to the choice of which auction design elements conducting a qualitative comparative analysis. Considering 269 auction rounds from 20 European countries in the period 2011\u20132020, not all resulting choices of auction designs are in line with auction theory and existing literature\u2019s findings on the relationship between objectives and auction design. Nevertheless, we show that on a country-level basis, most considered countries choose congruent auction designs, which either support all their (coherent) stated objectives or prioritise one or several of their incoherent objectives. For those countries with an incongruent auction design, we give recommendations on how to adapt their auction design depending on their exact choice of policy objectives.",

These relations depend on the local context and history in which RET projects are deployed. Despite being an everyday reality for all actors involved, the experience of time has not been of central concern for this research field. References to temporality in social acceptance work are both omni-present and frequently vague, used as a mere backdrop to the main story; most research has examined local residents' responses at a specific moment in a project's life cycle; some consider RET projects as independent from histories of infrastructure and place and people's relations with RETs as void of past experience. This paper advocates for a deeper engagement with time in the field. Based on a milestone literature review highlighting how time and history have been tackled in analyzing local residents' relations with RET projects in specific case contexts so far, we propose differentiating physical from historical time dynamics and by developing this distinction we offer a first conceptual framework for considering time in people's relations with RET projects. Through this, our proposal contributes to recent critical work in social acceptance research of RETs and provides analytical tools for researchers who intend to approach the temporal embeddedness of people's relations to RET projects.",

Since simple solutions like setback distances do not reflect the issue complexity, we incorporated acceptance factors from social science and interdisciplinary research in an Integrated Acceptance Model (IAM). To capture impact differences of the acceptance factors, in Study 1, residents of three operating wind farms in Germany (N = 158) were surveyed. Five most relevant acceptance factors were derived by a regression analysis: economic effects, impacts on residents and nature, attitudes towards the energy transition, trust in local actors and the planning process as well as social norms substantially explained local acceptance (R2 = 0.76). Next, in Study 2 the IAM was validated in an early stage, informal planning process in a Bavarian region (N = 92). In accord with Study 1, the IAM explained the variance in local acceptance comprehensively (R2 = 0.78). Moreover, a consistent impact of economic effects, attitudes towards the energy transition, expected effects on residents and nature as well as social norms was observed. While social norms played a pronounced role in Study 2, trust only related to the acceptance in Study 1. The IAM seems to capture the overall relevant acceptance categories, which can be used as guidance to create a sustainable green energy transition.",

To better understand why some residents experience stress effects from wind turbines a field study with strongly annoyed residents (SAR) was conducted. A convenience sample of residents (N = 148) in the proximity of a wind farm in Germany were interviewed using a standardised questionnaire. Objective features, such as number of visible WTs and distance to the nearest WT, could not explain the experienced noise annoyance substantially. Instead, SAR were characterised by a negative perception of both procedural as well as distributive fairness, the assumed decrease of property value due to the WTs, a negative attitude towards the local wind farm (but not to WTs in general), and higher noise sensitivity. Additionally, SAR reported to be affected daily during the night in their bedrooms, while other residents experience annoying situations more likely when they are directly exposed to WTs. Fast wind speeds, wet weather and, occasionally, frost or fog were associated with annoying situations. In accord with recent research, we recommend to increase consideration of participation and fairness in the initial planning of a wind farm to increase acceptance and reduce annoyance. Additionally, to reduce the fear of negative health impacts and to increase acceptance, mitigation measures depending on specific weather conditions seem to be promising.",

However, there is a temporal limitation to much social acceptance literature in that it does not consider how perceptions of the local community may change over the operational life of a wind farm and in the context of end-of-life applications for repowering or life-extension. In response, this paper increases the temporal depth of our understanding of social acceptance through presenting the results of survey research undertaken with communities living close to two English wind farms that have experienced end-of-life applications. For many respondents, perceptions of their local wind farm did not change following construction or over the life of the scheme, contrasting with common expectations that acceptance will increase over time. The findings reveal that community support for applications to repower or life-extend is influenced by experiences of living with the wind farm over time. It also shows how factors that have been found to impact perceptions of new wind farms, particularly the benefits that people experience, involvement in the planning process, and relationships with the developer, can influence responses to end-of-life applications. These insights are used to provide recommendations for end-of-life policy.",

However, social opposition to developer-owned wind farms is a key barrier to its deployment. While research suggests that co-ownership arrangements between developers and communities could help to alleviate opposition, such arrangements are subject to market acceptance issues related to citizens\u2019 appetite for investing. This paper explores the issue of market acceptance of citizen investment opportunities in wind farms by examining citizens\u2019 willingness to invest in projects. Based on a survey of 2,023 Irish citizens, we find that 56% of citizens would invest in a local project, 41% would invest in a portfolio of projects, and 29% would invest in a non-local project. Our empirical analysis reveals a number of socio-demographic, locational, community and attitudinal variables that affect both the decisions of citizens to invest in projects and the monetary amount that they are willing to invest. The findings of the paper provide insights into policy measures that could help to strengthen the market acceptance of citizen investment opportunities and will be useful for policymakers who are seeking to mobilise citizen investment with a view to enhancing the deployment of wind energy.",

A novel two-item measure reveals increased levels of acceptance over time and positive correlations between acceptance and having seen construction activities or the completed project. Regression and path analyses are consistent with values-beliefs-norms (VBN) theory, with underlying values (particularly altruism) and beliefs about the ocean and effects of the wind energy development explaining a substantial share of tourists' acceptance of the project. These findings suggest that rather than following narrow desires for an uninterrupted seascape, tourists\u2019 responses to offshore wind energy developments are influenced by deeper beliefs and guiding principles.",

Using a visual-only discrete choice design, we evaluate the preferences of US East Coast residents for offshore wind farms. As the offshore wind industry in the US moves forward and wind technology evolves, some developers have revised their project designs to use larger turbines. We examine how a wind farm's distance from the shore, project size, and turbine size factor into viewers' visual perception and willingness to accept potential projects. In addition, we test whether the presence of birds in the images impacts viewers' preferences for proposed projects. We find that distance from shore is overwhelmingly the most important factor for social acceptance, followed by project size, while turbine size had an insignificant effect. For participants who viewed images with birds, distance was the only significant factor. Our results suggest that getting to 30 GW by 2030 will require greater attention to public attitudes toward the visual impacts of proposed projects with a focus on the distance from shore.",

This question has come sharply into focus, as the reality of the need to decarbonise the buildings sector has become more urgent. Adding taxes and levies to energy prices encourages energy efficiency and raises revenues for governments, which can be dedicated to energy transition projects. But adding them disproportionately to electricity discourages us from investing in electrically powered heat pumps, a key technology in the buildings sector decarbonisation jigsaw. This paper shines a light on the imbalance in energy taxation across almost all European markets and makes the case for reform. We find that environmental costs are rarely well reflected in energy prices; and that the costs of energy transition programmes \u2013 and occasionally broader social policies \u2013 are overwhelmingly borne by electricity consumers. In this paper we explain the current structure of energy taxes and levies in five key European countries where reform would be beneficial, and set out four ways to rebalance energy taxes and levies, drawing on examples from around the continent.",

While many governments have implemented or announced policies to reduce building GHG emissions, it remains unclear whether these polices receive widespread public support and why. Using survey data from Canadian homeowners (n = 3,804), we explore (1) levels of homeowner support for specific types of home decarbonization policy in Canada and by Canadian region, (2) individual characteristics associated with support for specific policy types, and (3) heterogeneity across respondents based on patterns of policy support. Results indicate that the majority of homeowners (64\u201382%) support voluntary policies such as subsidies and loan programs for low-carbon heating technology, while compulsory policies (e.g., carbon taxes, renewable natural gas mandates) receive less support (38\u201349%). Characteristics associated with consistent support for most home decarbonization policies fall into five categories: altruistic values, climate concern, trust in scientists, positive perceptions of heat pumps, and higher education. Other characteristics are associated with specific policy types. Cluster analysis suggests that respondents fall into three groups: those supportive of all home decarbonization policies (43%), those supportive of voluntary policies only (37%), and those opposed to all home decarbonization policies (20%).

Adopting the SVAR model and divides the sample into two sub-samples according to the level of price regulation, it is found that the degree of price regulation of refined oil is very high before May 2009. At this time, the price regulation seriously hinders economic growth when the oil price falls. After May 2009, the degree of refined oil price control has been greatly reduced, and price control promotes the increase in industrial investment and GDP to a certain extent when oil prices rise and fall, and plays the function of \u201cshock absorber\u201d. In the post epidemic era, in the face of the current geopolitical conflict, it is necessary to continue to implement refined oil price control measures in line with China's situation in the short term, and gradually release oil price control in the long run to form a market price reflecting the relationship between supply and demand. In addition, it is necessary to improve and develop China's crude oil futures market as soon as possible and establish a modern oil circulation system.",

The results show that the drivers of the synergistic impact are mainly energy efficiency and industrial structure. Significant synergistic emission reduction effects exist in eastern China, western China, medium-sized transportation markets, and less developed tourism regions. Further, increasing environmental regulation can improve the synergistic reduction impact of the transportation sector's air pollutants and carbon emissions.

We consider 18 treatment cities and 10 control cities with no HSR to determine how the introduction of HSR affects CO2 emissions and analyze the factors that determined the disparity in HSR impacts. We find that CO2 emissions increased in the early construction period. However, HSR projects significantly and continuously decreased CO2 emissions for most treatment cities during the operation period. We also find that the CO2 reduction effect was larger in cities with more human capital and technological innovation. These findings provide empirical evidence that building HSR helps reduce CO2 emissions; governments should improve HSR technologies and expand HSR networks to promote environmentally friendly development.",

The Hong Kong MTR system shares 48% of the franchised transport boarding with the expense of only 4.9% of the annual energy consumption in the entire transport sector. In addition to the renowned business model: Rail plus Property model which has been quoted in many literatures, this study analyzes and discusses the design, operation, management, feeder bus service, and the government's policy and strategies on fossil fuel driven vehicle control.

However, the accumulation of batteries in landfills represents a huge problem in the medium-long term. These challenges become more relevant for islands. This article proposes to reuse batteries that are no longer useful for transportation as energy storage to recover renewable energy surpluses. A methodology for the techno-economical assessment of second-life car batteries as a storage solution in wind farms is presented. This method was successfully applied in two wind farms located on Tenerife island. The results delve into the feasibility of the solution, environmental impact, and government policies in terms of subsidy support. Moreover, extending the battery lifespan contributes to the circular economy, which aligns with the United Nations sustainable development goals on affordable and clean energy. In conclusion, second-life batteries could play an essential role as energy storage in the medium-long term on isolated systems.",

We develop a classification for policy aspects addressing DH, comprising regulation of ownership, prices, metering, consumer grid connection, third party access as well as support schemes and carbon taxes. This classification builds on existing literature and expert assessments collected in an online survey and interviews. The relevance of the paper lies in giving a comprehensive picture of the existing policy frameworks for DH in 23 European countries. For the overview, the countries are clustered along assigned categories. It is shown that the policy frameworks for DH can be clustered into five distinguishable groups. While some countries apply very strict regulations in special DH laws, others rely on less regulatory intervention, both with varying degrees of support for DH in place. The different policy frameworks are discussed in the context of the diffusion of DH and the integration of renewable and waste heat in DH. This analysis shows that high shares of DH and high shares of renewable and waste heat in DH can be observed in countries with a high degree of regulation as well as in countries with less regulatory intervention in DH markets.",

At present it is underutilized, making up just 4.5 per cent of renewable energy used in the UK, and a significant reason for this is the lack of clear regulatory framework for addressing the environmental impacts and supporting private investment. This article identifies the environmental and financial risks of both shallow and deep geothermal energy and analyses if, how, and to what extent they are addressed in the current regulatory regime. It finds that regulation of the environmental impacts is piecemeal and recommends reform of the regulatory regime to cover all geothermal energy systems and operations. This article also finds that the current regulatory framework fails to address the significant upfront costs of both shallow and deep geothermal energy operations or the potential for depletion of the geothermal resource on which they depend. It highlights the need for a regulatory regime that protects geothermal energy resources from overabstraction and balances the interests of multiple users, and for financial incentives to encourage growth of both the shallow and deep geothermal energy industries.",

The study objective is to investigate the relationship between gas consumption share, energy intensity, economic structure share, per capita gross domestic value, and population at the sectorial level from 1994 to 2020. This study analyzes the factors in three ways: first, the study applies decomposition analysis between key factors. Second, an appropriate decoupling method is applied to investigate the impacting factors to check the driving factors affecting the decoupling using the logarithmic mean Divisia index method. Third, based on aggregated and sectorial variations, the ratio decomposition of each sector is estimated. The results show that the economic activity effect is the main driving factor in raising gas consumption, which increased by 15.11 crore Tk./million during 1994\u20132020. The energy intensity trend declined by 14.87 Mtoe/crore Tk., which shows an imperative role in natural gas consumption efficiency for production and in economy. The economic structure share provided a record decline by 52.79 crores Tk. during the COVID-19 situation while a significant increase in gas consumption was found until 2013, which could be significant under decomposition changes. Three decoupling states such as expansive negative decoupling, expansive coupling and weak decoupling were found in which the decoupling relationship was gradually a dominated by a weak decoupling. The sectorial index provides a maximum of weak decoupling in which energy-saving technology gap change was found in power, captive power, industry, tea estate, compressed natural gas, and fertilizer sectors. Finally, the scenarios analyzed that natural gas consumption estimates maximum gross domestic product and conserves more energy in the future. Briefly, the decoupling process and its leading factors were obvious among nine major sectors.",

Research agendas and policy recommendations determined in HICs potentially yield the most influence on policymaking in LMICs. This risks leaving a multidimensional gap in how LMICs frame, evidence and enact policies. This paper is the first to provide quantitative evidence to geographical imbalances in energy policy research, and to shed light into the fact that research proposing energy policy coupled with development objectives to LMICs is dominated by HICs researchers. We find that the latter not only publish more articles proposing energy policy to LMICs, but also are more cited when doing so. We reach these findings by analysing the spatial dynamics of energy research on LMICs through a multi-method approach using bibliometric, network science and regression-based techniques. We established a framework using a sample of 6,636 papers from the Web of Science database, journal impact data from Scimago Journal Ranking and country economic data from the World Bank. Results show the existence of a cycle of imbalances across research practices. Most scientific articles recommending energy policy for LMICs have a primary author based in a HIC, funded by a HIC institution. The number of citations articles receive increases with the GDP of the country of primary author. Funders support authors based in countries of the same income band or higher. We recommend revising research practices and funding policies to place local actors and knowledge at the heart of energy policy research, enabling high-impact policymaking in LMICs.",

By using the IV-GMM technique, this paper explores the impact of the digital economy on renewable energy generation (REG) in Asian countries from 2003 to 2019, and further investigates the moderating effect of financial development, political stability, and the rule of law. The results indicate that the digital economy has a positive effect on REG. Moreover, financial development, political stability, and the rule of law positively moderate the nexus between the digital economy and REG. In addition, compared to developing Asian countries, the promotion effect of the digital economy on REG is more significant in developed Asian countries. Finally, in terms of regional heterogeneity, the impacts of the digital economy on REG are only significantly positive in East and South Asian countries. Asian countries should actively develop digital industries, build a stable political environment, enhance financial services, and achieve low-carbon energy transition in the region.",

Upgrading low temperature industrial waste heat using electric high-temperature heat pumps (HTHPs) can improve the overall energy-efficiency and mitigate CO2 emissions by replacing fossil fuels. The pulp and paper and the food and beverage industries use significant quantities of heat up to 200 \u00b0C and therefore have a high potential for the application of HTHPs. In order to assess the role of HTHPs, a techno-economic bottom-up cost optimization model is developed building on the Swiss TIMES Energy system Model (STEM). We present an advanced modeling framework including energy and material flows, with a high temporal resolution and a segregation of the temperature level of the process heat. The results show that HTHPs are cost-effective up to a temperature of 150 \u00b0C. Switzerland has the economic potential to deploy of about 100 MWth in the pulp and paper industry and 900 MWth in the food and beverage industry by 2050. Incentivizing the exploitation of this significant potential will require very high CO2 prices of several hundred \u20ac/tCO2 or additional policies to overcome investment barriers by supporting investment and flexible system-serving operation of heat pumps.",

Results illustrate that FM increases air pollution while QG decreases it for the global sample. Remarkably, the interaction of FM and QG shows that FM increases air pollution until a threshold of QG, then above this level, FM reduces air pollution. However, the impacts of FM, QG, and their interaction on air pollution depend on income levels. In low-income and lower middle-income countries, FM increases air pollution while QG reduces it, but the marginal effect of FM on air pollution in the presence of QG is still statistically positive because the pollution-decreasing effect of QG is weaker than the pollution-increasing effect of FM due to low QG. In upper middle-income and high-income countries, FM, QG, and their interaction reduce air pollution due to high QG; and QG intensifies the reducing effect of FM on air pollution. Moreover, the impact of FM on air pollution depends on various dimensions of FM and the moderating effect of QG for the global sample and sub-samples of different income-country groups. The findings imply that low-income and lower middle-income countries should prioritize in improving QG while upper middle-income and high-income countries should prioritize in boosting FM in the battle against air pollution.",

Policy intervention has a positive effect on FCEV diffusion. Infrastructure distribution plays a significant role in accelerating penetration rate at the early stage of the market. Although inevitably differences exist in the accessibility of hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs) by region due to various constraints, few studies have considered accessibility in detail. This study analyzes how policies that vary depending on time and space, including infrastructure distribution, impact demand for FCEVs. A multistage structure is employed in the analysis to reflect the influence of spatial factors. Vehicle preference is analyzed through a discrete choice experiment at the first stage. The second stage solves the location problem and predicts the market share of FCEVs by reflecting the feedback effect between FCEVs\u2019 market share and the accessibility of HRSs through a loop structure. The results indicate that improving access to HRSs positively affects the initial stage of the market; however, after accessibility reaches a certain level, it no longer affects the market share. The subsidies for hydrogen refueling costs bring a relatively rapid change to the gradually increasing penetration rate of FCEVs.",

This technology is especially suitable for the initial state of the power system transformation and demonstrates a good attitude in sustainable development view. DR also has the potential to improve the flexibility of Thailand power system in order to promote the growth of renewable energy (RE). This study analysed a DR business option where LAs (Load Aggregators) are the key actors that collect and managed committed DR resources. Our study proposed the establishment of LA#1, as lead and first level LAs, wherein LA#1 consists of state utilities. For non-utilities interested in the DR business, they will be designated as LA#2, or level two LAs, responsible for DR resources left out by LA#1. The study included an assessment of the DR market size, and analyses of our proposed DR business solution. The SWOT analysis showed that the strengths and opportunities outweighed the weaknesses and threats for a business option where the state utilities are the lead LAs and the ones primary doing the DR business. The BMC assessment provided a comprehensive analysis confirming that our proposed LA business operation, wherein having an LA#1 consisting of state utilities, should be the preferential DR business operation option under the current power market structure. The financial analysis also supported this business option of state utilities being LA#1.",

Therefore, evaluating the impact of NEDC on carbon emission efficiency is of great significance to this policy's development and improvement. This study selected 278 cities in China from 2003 to 2017 to explore the influence and the response mechanism of NEDC on carbon emission efficiency through the spatial difference-in-difference model (SDID). The result shows that NEDC not only significantly promotes the local carbon emission efficiency but also improves the carbon emission efficiency of the surrounding cities within 1000 km. Meanwhile, it promotes urban carbon emission efficiency through optimizing industrial structure, stimulating green technology innovation, and reducing energy intensity, among which the impact of green technology innovation was the strongest. Furthermore, the direct effect of NEDC on carbon emission efficiency is more significant in western, non-resource-based, non-industrial, and large cities in China. The radiation effect of NEDC has already appeared in eastern China, but the spatial spillover effect in large cities has not yet occurred. These findings will help further promote NEDC and provide important decision-making references for urban energy conservation and emission reduction.",

We assume that households choose between clean fuels (e.g., kerosene, LPG, solar, and electricity), dirty biobased fuels (e.g., firewood, animal dung, crop residues, and charcoal), and mixed fuels. We integrate socioeconomic data with high-resolution satellite data on forest conditions from the Uganda National Panel Survey. The findings from a random-effects multinomial logit model indicate that households in vegetated areas are 6\u20137% less likely to rely solely on dirty biobased fuels, and 6\u20138% more likely to use mixed fuels, compared to those in non-vegetated areas. A larger forest stock is more strongly associated with lower use of firewood than charcoal. A possible explanation for the findings is the presence of policies for forest conservation and enhanced forest property rights, which improve forest conditions and limit opportunities to collect firewood. Given households' dependence on forest-based fuels, such policies could need to be modified to secure households\u2019 access to these fuels.",

However, incumbent grid companies tend to prioritize grid stability and reliability and disregard resilience, which decreases end users\u2019 perceived benefits, intention, and adoption of the systems. The combined third-party ownership\u2013aggregation business model could drive adoption because it can enhance grid stability and reliability, and resilience at the same time. This study explores how the model works to increase the intention and adoption, and what policies and regulations are required to enable the model to mitigate the conflict of interest taking Miyakojima Island in Japan as a case study. The study finds that the model can increase adoption by reducing perceived risks. Policy and regulations, and resistance and inert of incumbent grid companies block the model from effectively working to change the benefit-sharing. Science-based regulations on the use of energy storage systems during power outages, stringent policy implementations of updated renewable energy targets and the 2050 carbon neutrality, and detailed time-of-use pricing can change the benefit-sharing in favor of end users and increase adoption.",

Planning the electricity generation portfolio is an important problem for the decision and policymakers, especially in terms of sustainable development, and it is crucial for T\u00fcrkiye's economic growth. In this paper, we study the long-term electricity generation portfolio optimization while considering the uncertainties. An optimization algorithm is modeled and solved while integrating uncertainty information as part of the Pareto concept. The results of three scenarios are presented and policy implications are discussed and compared with similar Turkish case studies and government projections. The results suggest that it is less risky to minimize emissions, thus, more likely to be sustainable than to minimize costs. Comparisons among solutions show that nuclear is a substitute for renewable resources and comparisons among other studies show that natural gas and hydro are substitutes for each other. Multi-objective formulation reveals that the government's scenario provides favorable results in business-as-usual conditions; however, nuclear and renewable investments that the government has planned are too ambitious to keep costs lower while decreasing emissions.",

We find that CO2 emissions show an inverted U-shaped trend of rising first and then falling during the governors\u2019 tenure, with the peak occurring in their nearly fourth year in office. The strategic investment and fiscal policies implemented by officials during their tenure provide an explanation for this finding. In particular, introducing CO2 emission reduction targets in the evaluation system of local officials shifts the strategic arrangements implemented by local officials during their tenure, with no significant effect of provincial governors\u2019 tenure on CO2 emissions.

The weighted average costs of capital (WACC) greatly impact RE production costs and influence the government support payments needed for the financial viability of RE projects. Reducing the risks for RE investors can decrease WACC and ensure that the EU meets its climate targets at the least cost. We investigate the potential for lowering support payments to RE projects by de-risking financing conditions through measures including revenue stabilization and low-risk auction designs for solar PV and onshore wind across 21 countries in Europe. We find that de-risking debt is almost twice as effective as de-risking equity. On average, support payments can be reduced by 3.3 EUR/MWh and 1.9 EUR/MWh, respectively, and in some cases, fall to zero. The effects differ across countries, higher-risk countries like Greece would experience more significant benefits from de-risking than lower-risk countries like Denmark and Germany, where support costs depend more on investment variables such as capacity factors. Overall, we show that WACC depends largely on country risk. Nonetheless, de-risking policies like revenue stabilization can improve the investment climate for RE, reduce the need for government support, and contribute to achieving decarbonization targets.",

Using the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) method to analyze factors influencing CEs, we find that economic development levels impact CEs the most in the operation stage; the impact coefficient reaches 3.81.

Increasing reliance on ecologically friendly technologies is widely considered to be a crucial means of achieving this objective. Many existing studies measure environmental performance using carbon dioxide emissions, or carbon sources, but do not consider the amount of carbon offset through sequestration in carbon sinks. We define carbon neutrality performance as the difference between the carbon sinks and carbon sources and quantify its relationship with green technological innovation, approximated using the notion of environmental productivity. We rely on the Chinese province-level data from 2001 to 2019 and demonstrate that green innovation can significantly facilitate the attainment of carbon neutrality objectives. Our mediation model suggests that low-carbon innovation can help reach carbon neutrality by decreasing net emissions directly, but also by inhibiting the urbanization rate and promoting renewable energy generation. Our analysis helps shed light on the possible strategies that policymakers in China and other developing countries can follow to realize their carbon neutrality aspirations.",

This study first evaluated the embodied energy intensities (EEIs) and embodied GHG intensities (EGHGIs) of China's 32 staple crops from 1997 to 2017. Then, a rebound quantization model was introduced to assess crop-specific GHG-REs. The decisive agronomic inputs for uneven crop-specific GHG-REs were further examined. Finally, a structural path analysis (SPA), combined with a structural path betweenness analysis was adopted to identify the high-priority energy paths involved in producing decisive agronomic inputs, in order to improve energy efficiency while curbing uneven crop-specific GHG-REs. The results show that: (1) grain crops generate larger GHG-REs than cash crops. (2) To prevent rapid growth in GHG-REs, six key and six potentially key staple crops must be paid adequate attention. (3) The energy efficiency of plastic film is the primary contributor to crop-specific GHG-REs; agricultural machinery, synthetic fertilizers, and seeds also play important roles. (4) Emphasis should be placed on energy-saving in the production of decisive agronomic inputs.

Within the domains of climate policies, punishment mechanisms are vital to ensure policy effects; nevertheless, very few studies have focused on inequality impacts of punishment mechanisms. In this paper, we attempt to narrow the research gap by using a dynamic recursive Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model to analyze how the designed ETS penalties affect inequality in China. The CGE model results show that ETS penalties induce uneven distribution of mitigation costs, output loss, and emission abatement among the sectors. ETS penalties slightly decrease household income and consumption inequality, denoted by the Gini coefficients; however, people's negative feelings about inequality are positively related to ETS penalties. The results imply that the current Chinese nationwide ETS market is not stringent enough to effectively achieve mitigation targets. In such a loose ETS policy, ETS penalties cannot give full play to regulate emission non-compliance and thus have minimal impacts on inequality. Hence, worldwide policymakers should not design too loose ETS policies to avoid undermining ETS punishment mechanisms.",

Consequently, WPPs compete with marginal generators rather than zero-cost generators in some hours. During these hours, WPPs have the ability to inflate wholesale market prices by withholding their generations. In this paper, we build a three-generator-two-hour model to analyze WPPs\u2019 ability and incentive to manipulate price in a sequentially structured electricity market. By exploring WPPs\u2019 cost structures and the dynamics by which prices respond to WPP\u2019s generation of current and adjacent hours, the analyses demonstrate that WPPs can have significant ability to manipulate price (ATMP). Furthermore, we propose an indicator to quantify the incentive to manipulate market prices (ITMP), which can be positive or negative, depending on whether additional revenues can be obtained by exercising market power. Case studies based on real-world data demonstrate that WPPs from ERCOT had the incentive to manipulate price in most hours in 2020 by strategic offering, i.e., the increase or reduction of the commitment in certain hours according to the available ramp rate of the system. It is urgent to develop relevant market regulation approaches. Two specific cases illustrate that WPPs can acquire extra revenue by adopting a particular strategy, i.e., the increase or reduction of the commitment in certain hours according to the available ramp rate of the system. The empirical simulation based on data from ERCOT in 2020, demonstrates that WPPs had the incentive to manipulate prices in most hours in 2020.",

Contagion tests based on changes in either individual linear/asymmetric or joint asymmetric dependence are applied to identify how policy shocks affect relevant sectors. These tests are also used to measure the extent to which policy is important in driving the policy shocks by measuring the sensitivity index of policy announcements and using network analysis. The empirical results show that China's NEV policies, including financial subsidies, tax exemption, dual credit schemes, and long-term development plan and management notice, have significant effects on its main industry chains and affiliated sectors through linear and joint asymmetric dependence channels. Of the eight policies, the long-term development plan and financial subsidies are found to be the most effective instruments in driving policy contagion more through asymmetric dependence than linear dependence channels, while tax incentives and management notices have the least effect. The up-, mid-, and downstream sectors of NEVs are more affected by NEV policy shocks than their affiliated sectors.",

In order to respond to climate change, China has constructed many hydropower projects during the past few decades. However, such large scaled infrastructure construction induced a large amount of embodied carbon emissions since many energy-intensive products were consumed. This study aims to account such embodied carbon emissions generated by the construction of hydropower infrastructure in China for a period of 2006\u20132015 by applying a hybrid method. The results show that the cumulative embodied carbon emissions from conventional hydropower projects and pumped-storage hydropower projects were 1.73E+08 tons and 1.40E+07 tons CO2 respectively. These embodied carbon emissions were mainly generated from construction engineering, electrical equipment, land expropriation and resettlement. Sichuan, Hubei, and Yunnan ranked the top three in terms of such embodied carbon emissions IEA, 2015, while Qinghai had the highest per capita embodied carbon emission. Guangdong and Zhejiang had the largest embodied carbon emissions from pumped storage hydropower projects. Installed capacity scale, location, and input field are three key influential factors on embodied carbon emissions. Finally, several policy recommendations are proposed to help mitigate such embodied carbon emissions by considering the Chinese realities.",

                    "abstract": "The evidence to date on the effectiveness of promoting \u2018consumer empowerment\u2019 in energy policy as a method to address consumer needs is limited and inconclusive, especially in light of power-relations amongst energy stakeholders which gives rise to both \u2018winners\u2019 and \u2018losers\u2019. As such, we challenge conventional wisdom by suggesting that emphasising consumer sovereignty reflects an abrogation of responsibility by policy makers, which unnecessarily imbues burdensome responsibilities to the consumer and household. This raises the question: if consumer empowerment is not delivering energy policy outcomes for consumers, then what should be the approach? We challenge four key assumptions commonly used to advocate for greater \u2018consumer empowerment\u2019 and instead introduce an alternative paradigm of shared value. While traditional economic theory argues that markets maximize shared value (i.e., Adam Smith's invisible hand) then it is assumed that the behaviour of consumers is rational and is fully informed, although there is ample evidence that neither of these assumptions hold. Thus, shared value has to be achieved differently. When value is shared across the key stakeholders in a market, collective impact is achieved which fosters shared understanding of the problems and shared responsibility for addressing these problems, resulting in more amenable and effective solutions. Within the context of the deregulated Australian energy market, this conceptual paper introduces the Ecosystem of Shared Value framework (Kramer and Pfitzer, 2016) to the energy sector and explains how policymakers can implement the five key elements: common agenda and language; shared measurement system; mutually reinforcing activities; dedicated \u2018backbone\u2019 support; frequent and transparent communication. We note that consumer empowerment does not solve the scarcity problem in the current energy crisis, whereas the shared value approach has the potential to align the interests of producers and consumers in most contexts. Wherever there is a scarcity of resources, whether they are consumer, government or natural resources, the shared value approach provides utility. Exceptions would be in situations where energy is a free resource, or in civil uprisings where it would be difficult to enact.",

However, the possible influence of solar PV on EV uptake within a spatial-temporal framework is often overlooked in the literature. Based on a unique dataset at a detailed spatial level in Auckland, New Zealand, this study explores the potential complementarity of EVs and solar PV using spatial negative binomial regression models. We find evidence of complementarity between solar PV and EV uptakes. Results show that a one-unit increase in the installation of solar PV is associated with an increase in EV uptake count by a factor of 1.021. Households investing in solar PV also have the potential to accelerate EV uptake. Moreover, we find that a one-unit increase in EV charger installation in neighbouring areas is associated with an increase in EV uptake by a factor of 41. Charging infrastructure in neighbouring areas has a positive impact on subsequent EV adoption. Additionally, EV uptake is increased by 1.047\u20131.049 in response to a one-unit increase in early EV adoption, indicating that the early-adopter phase also positively impacts subsequent EV uptake. Our findings provide important insights for policy aimed at increasing EV uptake.",

The study found that: (1) energy poverty is still widespread in China, especially in the central and western regions. And the low energy affordability is its major source; (2) the development of Internet can alleviate energy poverty. On one hand, it can improve energy affordability by promoting economic development and technological progress. On the other hand, it also helps to enhance the availability of energy by promoting technological advances and improving knowledge level; and (3) there are nonlinear and regional heterogeneous effects of the development of Internet on the alleviation of energy poverty.

We find that the elasticity of the wholesale electricity price with respect to the regulated retail price was around \u22121 before the pandemic.

This research seeks to understand factors of the TOU plan that impact voluntary enrollment with the purpose of identifying levers that are at the disposal of a utility to increase voluntary enrollment. We conducted an survey experiment of people living in the United States. The survey randomized the peak to off-peak price ratios, the peak hours, and the number of TOU plans being offered. Our results indicate several policy-relevant findings. On average, when only one TOU plan is offered, the peak to off-peak price ratio has no impact on enrollment decisions. Respondents who are offered more than one TOU plan are 14.2 percentage points more likely to enroll than respondents only offered one TOU plan, which suggests that the ability to compare TOU plans is an important mechanism. Further, when multiple plans are presented, the average respondent is price responsive, preferring TOU plans with a large peak to off-peak price ratio (larger price spread). Lastly, people prefer shorter on-peak period lengths when either one or multiple plans are offered.",

To assess electricity affordability, the study proposed a probabilistic method to quantify the households into different electricity categories for both urban and rural areas. Alternative electricity billing schemes based on Scenarios A to D for the households to enhance legal connection and consumption of electricity were proposed. The study established that the utility registers the highest electricity theft losses in rural households. The monthly utility revenue collected in urban areas was about 2.9 times that collected in rural areas because of the higher number of legally connected households with a monthly consumption of 1.5 times than that of rural households. From the monthly income spendable on electricity, rural and urban households could only afford 25.07 kWh and 38.29 kWh, respectively, which are less than the average household electricity consumption for Uganda. Also, the initial connection fee to the power grid is very high for the households to afford it in a single down payment. Of the proposed alternative billing schemes, Scenario B and Scenario D yield the least monthly utility revenue collected for the urban and rural households, respectively.",

The impact of ultra-low emission standards (ULES) on corporate productive performance cannot be ignored. Taking the implementation of ULES as a quasi-natural experiment, and using data for listed companies from 2010 to 2018, this paper studies the influence of ULES on the upgrading of thermal power plants using a difference-in-difference (DID) model. The results indicate that ULES significantly inhibits improvements in the productivity of thermal power corporations. This conclusion remained valid after a PSM-DID estimation, the interference of carbon emission trading policy and the 13th Five-Year Plan double control index management on the regression coefficient was eliminated, and a placebo test was used to eliminate interference from other unobservable factors. Further analysis shows that ULES affect corporate productive performance by increasing costs, squeezing out innovation, and reducing efficiency. Moreover, non-state-owned corporations, corporations with highly constrained finances, and corporations in China's eastern region are more obviously affected by ULES. Although ULES for thermal power generation has significantly improved environmental performance, the design of environmental standards should also consider the economic costs, and risks of the green and low-carbon transition process.",

Then, based on the ARDL model, the factors influencing the decoupling relationship are empirically tested and analyzed. The findings are threefold. (1) In the long term, the decoupling is effectively promoted by the relative energy price index, the increase in the clean energy proportion and the strengthening of government intervention. And the decreases in research and development investment, foreign trade, and the ratio of tertiary to secondary industry elicit the same direction on the decoupling relationship. (2) In the short term, the decline in the current increment of government intervention is the strongest contributor to the decoupling relationship, followed by the rise in the current increment of the ratio of the tertiary to the secondary industry. (3) The combined results of historical decomposition, impulse response, and variance decomposition indicate that clean energy share shocks, research and development intensity shocks, and relative energy price index shocks are the main sources of Dr fluctuations. The results of the study can provide a reference for achieving carbon reduction in China.",

We discovered that (1) the spatial pattern of CRS is highly consistent with the basic geographic pattern. The coal resource security indexes (CRSIs) have apparent spatial differentiation. CRS shows differences in coal endowment and circulation, supplemented by differences in economic activities and environmental impacts. (2) The CRSIs have spatial autocorrelation, and the overall agglomeration trend is apparent. Due to coal development and administrative attributes differences, the CRSI shows different agglomeration types in each county. (3) Degree in coal aggregation, etc., are the dominant indicators for spatial differentiation of CRS in the whole basin of the YRB. The factor driving forces are significantly different. The driving force of two-factor interaction is more vital than that of single-factor interaction, and the interaction type is mainly nonlinear enhancement.",

They are usually introduced to ensure sufficient incentives for investors to maintain optimal capacity when the energy-only markets fail. However, although this mechanism should be technologically neutral, it is important to learn how the substantial funds transferred from consumers are allocated. With this in mind, this study analyses capacity auction results and provides evidence-based findings on the spending of capacity market funds. To achieve this research objective, the Polish capacity market is taken as an example of a capacity market introduced in a power system heavily dependent on fossil fuels and undergoing slow decarbonisation. The analysis covers six auctions for the 2021\u201326 delivery years. The results show that the key beneficiaries are coal units to which, on average, over 67% of the total budget is allocated. They will receive EUR 412\u2013917 million/year in the period analysed. Capacity markets should increase competitiveness and create incentives; however, the evidence from Poland indicates that it mainly supports the existing, high-emission units operating within state-owned companies. Although the study is conducted for Poland, the findings provide sound lessons for other countries considering the introduction of a capacity market.",

To study this, we examined the preferences of Finnish residential consumers to DLC DR. The analysis from consumer responses resulted in the following findings: Firstly, the cluster analysis identified three distinctive consumer subgroups. Secondly, a multinomial-logistic regression provided the influence of gender, education, living conditions and income level on the consumer subgroups. Thirdly, a Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) showed the effect of age group, presence of children and number of people in the household on the subgroups. Finally, an ANOVA test provides the influence of consumer characteristics on the DLC DR motivators. The results highlight the heterogeneity of different subgroups and the influence of consumer parameters on DLC DR motivators. The findings of this study have novel and practical implications for energy flexibility among residential consumers. The policy implications arising from this study are discussed which are essential to consider for widespread adoption of DR.",

However, how does the lofty ideal of justice translate for communities distant from elite centers of knowledge and power? Focusing on women from rural communities in Benin, Senegal, and Togo, this paper applies the double lens of gender and capability to energy justice principles and addresses the following questions: 1) How do these rural women currently experience energy justice principles? And 2) What energy interventions could enhance these women's capabilities in the future? The findings from our field interviews offer a diagnostic of energy justice for rural women, connecting the limited availability and affordability of energy sources to sustainability concerns in a vicious cycle of resource scarcity and impaired capabilities. We then propose interventions to apply justice principles in the local context and argue that operationalizing energy justice requires making gender equity a cross-cutting dimension in the energy justice framework. We contend that building just energy systems by 2050 would be best achieved by focusing on human capabilities, i.e., promoting people's opportunities to live the life they value over allegedly universal energy metrics.",

Taking a longitudinal approach, we review planning protocols covering four years of negotiations over this new mitigating technology in the case of a proposed wind farm to be located along a major international corridor for migrating birds. We develop three separate indicators of institutional acceptance and demonstrate how exposure to different types of uncertainties influenced acceptance of the technology over time. We also show how various responses to these uncertainties can resolve gridlocks around institutional acceptance. The study offers insights into the development of negotiations strategies for different stakeholders over time. It also offers recommendations for policy designed to resolve issues inhibiting institutional acceptance, including data gathering and exchange, issue linkage strategies, and incremental regime building.",

Both participatory processes and outcomes which recognise local impacts are necessary for the acceptance of onshore wind farms. This paper distinguishes between shared community benefit funds, near-neighbour compensation, and citizen investment relative to issues of ownership, modes of engagement and the management of financial benefits during siting, construction, and operation of a wind farm respectively. Citizens willing to accept place greater importance on factors associated with distributive and procedural justice, while proximity and related visual impacts have comparatively more importance for citizens unwilling to accept. Willingness to accept is associated with early, in-person, engagement with a community liaison officer during siting and citizen participation in the governance and distribution of financial benefits during operation. However, citizens who show conditional support for wind farm developments prefer compensation of near-neighbour households, semi-state developers, and town hall engagement meetings. Strong supporters are more influenced by financial benefits for the wider community and local (co-)ownership of wind farms, particularly joint ventures between the developer and community.",

Several regions, however, are dual peaking with distinct summer and winter peaks of roughly equal magnitude. Deep decarbonization of our energy system could lead to greater instances of dual or winter peaking power systems across the country. This seasonal shift has important implications for grid operations. Furthermore, the compounding impacts of decarbonization strategies and climate change could introduce new challenges in ensuring sufficient generator availability during peak demand. This paper provides policy recommendations to plan for a shift to dual or winter peaking power systems. We first analyze the seasonal peak demand trends between 2016 and 2021 at the regional and subregional levels. We provide key examples of how regulators and system operators plan for winter resource adequacy, focusing on the measures undertaken by different stakeholders, post-Winter Storm Uri. We then detail challenges posed by the multilevel regulation framework in planning for winter peaking power systems for both extreme cold events and a gradual shift due to electrification. Finally, we provide our policy recommendations for utilities and regulators on how they can robustly meet the challenges of winter peaking systems.",

However, there has been little investigation of how political dynamics systematically influence these models' development and outputs, or the implications for energy strategies, targets and interventions. Using in-depth interviews with 24 European modellers and policyworkers, we illuminate the politics of economic modelling within European Union (EU) energy policymaking, focusing on dynamics of contestation, differentiated influence and power relations within models' a) framing of questions and problems; b) framing of scenarios and solutions; c) structural assumptions and d) definition of quantitative data inputs. We then consider deeper questions of e) access and exclusion, showing how modelling is used to silence critical voices and reinforce incumbent interests. We argue that understanding this politics of modelling is crucial to the implementation of sustainable energy transitions. We conclude with recommendations for researchers and policyworkers seeking to promote the use of alternative/innovative models in energy policy (within and beyond the EU), centring on reflexivity; recognition; and relationship-building. Developing multi-sectoral \u2018communities of practice\u2019 around innovative modelling approaches is vital in challenging a vicious circle of evidence and policy that legitimises business-as-usual in a dangerously warming world.",

However, the average age of nuclear power plants is approaching 37 years of operation in 2022, which is likely to lead to increased outages and expensive maintenance. In addition, newer nuclear power plants are flexible to operate and thus compatible with high volatile feed-in from renewables. Nevertheless, it is controversially discussed whether nuclear power plants can still be operated competitively and whether new investments will be made in this technology. Using an agent-based simulation model of the European electricity market, the market impacts of possible nuclear investments are investigated based on two scenarios: a scenario with state-based investments and a scenario with market-based investments. The results of this investigation show that under our assumptions, even with state-based investments, carbon neutrality would not be achieved with the estimated nuclear power plant capacity. Under purely market-based assumptions, large amounts of gas-fired power plants would be installed, which would lead to an increase in France\u2019s carbon emissions. State-based investments in nuclear power plants, however, would have a dampening effect on neighboring spot market prices of up to 4.5% on average.",

Our societies are faced with a unique opportunity for changing people's behaviours and improving their lives. In the EU, the Green Deal is saluted as a new package of policy interventions aiming at achieving social goals such as job creation and reducing economic inequality \u2013 mostly by means of renewable energy and resource efficiency. However, the ongoing energy transition has been affected by COVID-19-related policy measures. This work proposes to give insights into the EU citizens' pre-pandemic perception of some key renewable energy transition, sustainability and resilience factors, which may be crucial with a view to finding prime energy policy indications useful for the post-pandemic recovery. Making use of 2019 EU Eurobarometer data, selected aspects of EU citizens' perceptions of energy policy are evaluated. Logit regressions are estimated to render energy perceptions modelling. Results suggest evidence of interrelated renewable energy transition issues for the EU, including resilience, vulnerability, cooperation, competition, sovereignty, security, safety and climate change. The findings indicate important social and environmental implications for energy policy modelling. The diversity of sorting results, regional-level differences and embodied domestic characteristics allow for macro-regional explorations.",

This study, based on a case-study approach, revisits the reform progress and plans in the electricity sector of PNG alongside the development and integration of IPPs in its small power system. Lessons of reform experiences and IPPs integration are drawn from three other smaller systems of Nepal, Nicaragua and the Northern Territory of Australia including stakeholder consultations, which includes two IPPs of PNG. We find a widening gap between reform \u2018theory\u2019 and \u2018practice\u2019 in the PNG power sector. Cost reflective pricing is implemented while cost recovery is never achieved by the vertically integrated state-owned utility and the insolvency of this state-owned single buyer poses the greatest perceived revenue risk to the IPPs. This lack of revenue reimbursement to the IPPs by the single buyer is a barrier towards attracting private capital into electricity generation. We recommend that strong political will and strengthening of institutional arrangements are urgent reform measures to attract private capital in power generation as political instability continue.",

One such issue is the extent of informal solid fuel use, that is, consumption from sources outside of formal commercial channels. This is an area which has been largely ignored in previous empirical research. Using a survey of residential solid fuel users, the extent of solid fuel use in the residential sector in Ireland from informal sources for two fuels, sod peat and wood, is quantified. Sod peat is found to be almost exclusively sourced informally while just over half of wood use is estimated to be sourced by households in this way. Factors including location, household income, being a primary user of the fuel and having strong cost motivations all effect the probability of sourcing solid fuels informally relative to formal sources. The sizeable extent to which informal sources of solid fuels are used in Ireland arising from the analysis in this paper, highlights the potential for substitution to this unregulated alternative. This should be carefully monitored for effective implementation of new and existing solid fuel regulations.",

To highlight outcomes empirically, unanimously accredited Alkire and Foster's (2008) indexing methodology and well-organized cross-sectional data of PSLM of the last decade have been used. An assessment of the study reveals that multidimensional energy poverty is purely a farming phenomenon for agro-climatic zones of Pakistan. However, the time-variant situation evaluates that in the smaller (longer) frame of time, energy poverty presents a hybrid (increasing) trend between both discussed communities and across all the agro-climatic zones except cotton-wheat Sindh. Moreover, a relative change in energy poverty shows that in non-farming communities, the declining rate of energy poverty has been immensely satisfying for the last decade.

Yet, their effectiveness has often been below expectations. In this paper we empirically test arguments based on social practice theory that this underperformance is not the result of people making ill-informed or economically questionable decisions but reflects the complexities of social synchronization. Using sequence-network analysis, we visualize and comparatively analyze time-use data from the US and China to capture everyday temporalities of a particular time-inflexible group \u2013 child caregivers. Findings show that timing and sequencing of peak activities for caregivers in both countries were largely structured by institutional and family rhythms, though with considerable differences in extent and timing of influences due to diverging childcare cultures. The necessity to follow these rhythms leaves caregivers little room to adjust their peak activities to ToU tariffs, turning this well-intended measure into an inequitable financial burden on the group. We argue that policymakers should deploy time-varying tariffs in ways that align with everyday temporalities of population groups. Cutting critical and daily peaks in ways that work with people\u2019s temporal (in)flexibilities in everyday practices could be a key to the effectiveness of energy measures.",

Yet, I claim that donors' commitment to restore and develop infrastructures to generate, distribute, store and manage energy may boost an upswing of the manufacturing sector in post-conflict settings. This is because, first, as opposed to conventional developmental aid, post-conflict aid is proven to be unusually productive and unlikely to trigger the appreciation of the real exchange rate. Second, because restoring and enhancing energy infrastructures is expected to increase the return on investments in the manufacturing sector. To test my hypothesis, I resort to a cross-section time-series two-stage least squares multivariate analysis covering 45 post-conflict countries between 1970 and 2013. I find that donors' commitment to rebuild and enhance energy infrastructures in post-conflict countries has positive effects on the manufacturing sector of recipient countries both in the short and in the medium term. These findings contribute both to shed more light on the impact of foreign aid in fragile and post-conflict countries, and to the literature investigating the impact of electrification in developing economies.",

However, success of mini-grid projects can be hindered by poor cash flows and limited revenue returns. A clear understanding of off-grid households\u2019 preferences for electricity services is a prerequisite for mini-grid stakeholders to set tariff structures and stimulate income-generating power demand to scale up mini-grid deployment. This study conducted a choice experiment survey in two off-grid villages targeted by new mini-grid projects in Tanzania to reveal heterogeneity in households\u2019 preferences for multiple electricity service attributes. We found that households\u2019 heterogeneous preferences were significantly associated with demographic (e.g. gender), socioeconomic (e.g. ownership of TV), and energy-related behavioural characteristics (e.g. charging devices away from home). We suggest that service-based, tiered tariffs and business models can be designed to cater for the heterogenous demands and preferences of different segments of customers. Successful deployment of mini-grids needs to consider the competition from the existing solar home systems and focus on the provision of higher tiers of electricity services. Gender equality issues should be addressed in rural electrification efforts given the significantly greater vulnerability of female-led households to higher electricity fees.",

This research takes the solar PV technology as an example to explore whether having state-owned financial institutions, such as national development banks (NDBs), offers advantages in a country for mobilizing finance. By focusing on three selected country cases (The United States without NDBs, Germany with a big NDBs, and China with huge NDBs), the paper first reviews the evolution of solar PV finance mobilization in the three countries from the 1990s to 2018. It then examines the financial strategies and impacts of NDBs and the alternative approaches that the three countries use to address financial challenges for solar PV deployment at different stages. The paper finds that NDBs' direct financier role in the early deployment stage is most important and irreplaceable. Alternative policies can fulfill most facilitative roles of NDBs in unlocking private finance, except NDBs' learning bank role. NDBs' role in channeling information between governments and markets is also hardly replaceable. The paper provides insights for policymakers and implementers of countries aiming to set up NDBs to scale up low-carbon energy technologies.",

It quantitatively estimates the factor allocative efficiency, cost elasticity and marginal cost of the energy decarbonization practice in China from 2004 to 2019. Estimation results show that: (i) there is a \"structural dividend\" effect of energy restructuring in China. On average, a 1% increase in the level of decarbonization of the energy structure reduces the total cost by 0.57% and the marginal cost by 5.846 billion yuan. Specifically, a 1% reduction in the share of coal consumption reduces the marginal cost by 4.590 billion yuan. (ii)Energy restructuring has accelerated factor allocation distortions in recent years. In terms of the impact of energy decarbonization on productivity growth, the inhibition of factor allocation distortion on productivity growth mainly comes from scale effect. (iii)Energy restructuring has a heterogeneous impact on productivity growth across provinces. Productivity growth in energy-consuming regions is lower than that in energy-supplying regions, while the regions where factor allocation distortions have a greater impact on productivity growth are mostly found in the central and western parts of the country where factor markets are less developed.",

First, the ARMA-EGARCH-ARJI model is applied to describe the characteristics of global oil fluctuations. Then, we use three specific models to discuss the impact of the expected and unexpected global oil price shocks and the global oil price jumps and explore whether there are corresponding price jumps in the automobile markets. We find that there are asymmetric effects of the influences of the expected and unexpected global oil shocks. Moreover, there is a lag effect of the global oil price jumps on the automobile markets. In addition, global oil price jumps lead to \u2018U-shaped\u2019 responses in the automobile markets. In contrast to the literature, we introduce factors of price jumps into the subject market and the global oil market, and we discuss the effects of different types of global oil price shocks in detail, especially those concerning the influence of oil price jumps.",

An important question for policy makers is how to minimize the negative impact of the risk of subsidy termination on industrial investment. We assume the social planner aims to increase capacity and welfare and uses a subsidy, which has an uncertain lifetime, for the purpose. We examine a monopolist supplying an uncertain demand, faced with the option to expand capacity by irreversibly investing in small increments. We find that the firm installs capacity expansions sooner and, consequently, installs a larger capacity than a firm without a subsidy. A firm\u2019s total investment during the subsidy\u2019s lifetime increases with both the subsidy size and the likelihood of subsidy withdrawal. However, this happens at the cost of less investment directly after the subsidy has been retracted. The optimal subsidy size strongly depends on the point in time at which the social planner aims to maximize the welfare \u2014 the further into the future, the larger the welfare optimal subsidy. Furthermore, the welfare optimal subsidy size strongly depends on the social planner\u2019s discretion over adjustments to the subsidy size.",

We show that feed-in tariffs have so far failed to exploit the technical small-scale PV potential evenly across regions. This implies significant differences in the allocation of regulatory benefits and costs associated with the promotion of renewable energy sources, leading to a situation of increasing socioeconomic inequality: few counties benefit strongly and many counties bear the costs. Over the past 20 years, in addition to margin effects due to disproportionately high feed-in tariffs, this inequality has increasingly been driven by steadily rising self-consumption. This leads, on average, to differences of over 40 percent in effective electricity costs between households with and without PV. We conclude that the current regulatory framework is insufficient to bring solar PV up to the needed level and to distribute the associated benefits and costs equitably across households. Based on this, we derive guiding principles of a future regulatory framework that enables more effective scaling of small-scale PV.",

NEM aids utilities in reducing power constraints and line losses and effect positive economic gains by integrating renewable energy sources. In Pakistan, the current NEM market is limited to three-phase users, even though single-phase customers account for 90% of all residential connections, equal to 28 million, and can significantly impact Pakistan's NEM growth. Therefore, the conducted study provides the techno-economic evaluation of NEM for single-phase consumers. The article offered policy proposals to encourage distribution companies (DISCOs) and single-phase customers to adopt NEM to achieve a win-win situation. The technical analysis is conducted to see how the single-phase NEM affects voltage regulation, system unbalances, and line losses. The viability of the current feed-in tariff for single-phase NEM consumers is assessed to analyze the economic impact. The results show that if only 5% single-phase NEM is allowed, 7.54 TWh can be renewably added to the grid, reducing 4.95 Mtonn CO2 emissions. Furthermore, this paper presents a case study of how the consumer and the DISCOs can benefit from several NEM penetration. The presented analysis and policy recommendations may help Pakistan and other countries with identical socio-demographic profiles.",

The strength of the overlap of these conditions and their causal mechanisms has not been assessed across Ireland prior to this study. We apply and analyse existing and novel energy and transport poverty metrics in a survey of 1564 participants across Ireland and consider results from expenditure and consensual data examining causal mechanisms and correlations. We find that energy and transport poverty rates are broadly similar across Ireland at approximately 14% for energy poverty and 18% for transport poverty using the half-median metric, while participant knowledge of causal factors, such as lack of domestic energy efficiency and perceived desirability of potential poverty solutions, such as increased public transport provision, are low. Furthermore, we find that self-reported data concerning energy and transport expenditures and preferences do not correspond to expected outcomes. We thus conclude that ever refined targeting of individuals and households for support measures is not optimal for either decarbonisation or alleviation of energy and transport poverty conditions and suggest some salient policy implications.",

We find that the change in fuel mix has little contribution to driving the economywide energy intensity of the service sector down during the study horizon. Instead, the change in energy intensity contributes to a decrease in economywide energy intensity of service sectors in most countries except the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, and Turkey. Moreover, since energy intensity is inseparable from economic development, changes in economic structure are an essential determinant of the economywide energy intensity of service sectors. This work also analyzes the sectoral attribution and energy feedstocks attribution of economywide energy intensity of the service sectors.",

We have shown that, in the German case, the auction scheme is unable to promote wind deployment at competitive prices, and that the design elements used to promote the secondary objectives not only fall short at achieving their intended goals, but create incentives for large actors to game the system.",

This study investigates the industrial linkage of domestically owned agents and MNEs in global carbon emissions during the 2005\u20132016 period from both the demand and supply side via a multiregional input-output method. Industrial linkages are analyzed from the perspectives of both production and spatial linkage. The results show that the forward linkages of domestic agents on the supply side mainly lead to an increase in global carbon emissions. Second, the spatial linkage is more influential than the production linkage in global carbon emissions in most cases. Global carbon emissions are spatially lock-in some specific regions, such as China and South Africa. Third, MNEs transfer energy-intensive industries to developing regions and cause carbon leakage. We highlight that spatial linkage has an important role in global carbon emissions.

The policies (and policy proxies) investigated are Feed-in-tariffs (FITs), Public R&D stock and flow, Environmental tax, and Environmental Policy Stringency Index. The policies are within the control of national government and no EU level policies are investigated. Evaluating policies on several dimensions is highly important since there is a risk that policies can promote one aspect of technological progress such as invention but derail diffusion. A Schumpeterian technological development approach is utilised on a panel dataset covering 23 European countries between 2000 and 2019. Two econometric approaches are employed, a negative binomial regression model is used to assess inventions and a panel data fixed effect regression is used for the diffusion model. The empirical findings suggest that no counteracting policy effects were present.",

Gini coefficients were used to measure inequality within each province, while the regional environment inequality index was used to measure inequality between provinces. The energy consumption showed a decreasing trend from the eastern coast to the western interior. In contrast, the per capita energy consumption showed an increasing trend from the southeastern coast to the northwestern interior. In 2015, the high-income groups accounted for 45% of the country's total energy consumption, while the low-income groups accounted for only 4%. Between 2012 and 2017, the level of inequality in energy consumption between provinces gradually increased, while the level of inequality within provinces gradually decreased. Among the various consumption categories, the Gini coefficients for necessities were generally smaller, whereas those for services were generally larger. However, the differences between consumption categories gradually decreased.",

However, this land expansion increases the pressure on land-use change and management. This paper seeks to estimate the technical efficiency and decompose the total factor productivity (TFP) in the sugar-ethanol industry using a stochastic frontier framework. Primary data was obtained from an unbalanced panel of 90 sugar and ethanol producers for the harvest years from 2012/2013 to 2016/2017, providing 209 valid observations. Results suggest that mills have a small gap to increase their efficiency under the current technology, and the industry's TFP has been primarily impacted by the efficiency effects, on the other hand, SE mills might improve TFP rising their scale of production. Therefore, the results in this paper suggest that small SE mills may benefit from merging with other mills to explore economies of scale to enhance their TFP and strengthen economic competitiveness, contributing to the Brazilian environmental policy agenda.",

Using critical discourse analysis and critical geopolitics, the article explores how the neoliberal and realist narratives were applied in the EU's international (Russia-focused) energy transition cooperation. The neoliberal narrative presupposed fine-tuned multilateralism and market openness, with an opportunity for Russia to join the EU's success story. The realist narrative was based on the notions of relative gains, strategic autonomy/sovereignty, market corrections by public authorities, borders and closed alliances, Russia was used in this narrative to encourage more EU autonomy and strategic partnerships. The article demonstrates how and why the geopolitical narrative was strengthened between 2020 and 2021. It reveals the similarities between the neoliberal and realist narratives regarding the policy framework and relative positions of the EU and Russia in the spacialisation of the green energy policy. As a result, no policy opening for selective engagement with Russia emerged; rather, the 2020\u20132021 discourse prepared the EU for a policy shift that it took to react to Russia's assault against Ukraine in February 2022.",

Reaching carbon neutrality before 2070 requires the deep decarbonization of this sector. This study assesses the potential of battery electric vehicles (BEV) and fuel-cell vehicles (FCV) as the least-cost pathway toward carbon neutrality. We estimate the future demand for passenger and freight services and evaluate the impact of EV policies using the Integrated Model of Energy, Environment, and Economy for Sustainable Development/Technology (IMED/TEC). The study covers road transport emissions, energy, and air pollution transitions under four scenarios, including reference, low, medium, and high penetration of BEV and FCV, which align with the decarbonization target agreed upon under India's national policy. Results show that the carbon neutrality target would be challenging with BEV alone in road passenger and freight transportation because it is less efficient. Combined penetration of BEV and FCV can reduce air pollutant emissions significantly. Operative implementation of FCV could diminish more than 96% of the total road transport CO2 emissions. The analytical framework also proposes local climate change policies towards a carbon neutrality strategy to escalate the share of BEV and FCV in the Indian road transport sector.",

In this context, the potentials in using thermal storage capacities in district heating (DH) systems have been brought forward, primarily by academic scholars. Using a \u2018grounded\u2019 approach, this study investigates if professionals assigned to Swedish DH companies and electricity distribution system operators utilise, or plan to utilise, DH systems as flexibility services for the electricity grid. Original data was collected through semi-structured interviews, held with fourteen individuals affiliated to different actors in the Swedish energy system. These individuals were identified as being experts, or practically engaged, in using DH utilities as flexibility services for the electricity grid. The findings show that although technologies for coupling between DH systems and the electricity grid are already in place, initiatives for using DH systems as flexibility services for the electricity system are rare in Sweden. Coupling challenges stem from ownership and operation legislation frameworks, marginal incentives and a widespread focus on firm benefits rather than energy systems benefits. Identified initiatives for using DH systems for flexibility services are primarily run on a local scale, designed and propelled by small groups of engaged individuals.",

Indeed, storage facilitates the penetration of electricity from renewable sources into the grid by reducing the variability of renewable generation. Despite its importance, electricity storage is still perceived as a risky activity. The risk derives from the widespread need to secure multiple revenue streams in order to ensure profitability. This article investigates the risks influencing the development of electricity storage in the EU regulatory framework, focusing on benefit stacking. Benefit stacking refers to the diversification of services a storage asset can provide. This article evaluates some of the main regulatory barriers to benefit stacking in the EU electricity market and provides policy strategies to derisk this activity. The study is carried out using a multilevel analysis: the obstacles to stacking electricity storage services are investigated in EU law as well as in national law. After analysing the obstacles, policy recommendations are proposed to foster benefit stacking at both levels.",

In the next five decades, economically optimized energy transition towards renewables is crucial for India to reduce CO2 emissions in an affordable manner. India has installed a large fleet of solar PV, and thus, maximizing their capacity factors plays an influential role in energy transition. This study examines how the state of Karnataka managed to enhance solar PV capacity factor by two-thirds with substantially reduced curtailment from 2017 to 2019. We built, calibrated, and validated a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model with detailed hourly data to quantify the impacts of two major policy changes, being shifting electricity consumption of irrigation from night-time to daytime (load shift) and dispatching electricity generation units by their merit order (economic dispatch). Our results indicate that these two measures could explain about 20% and 70% of the capacity factor increase, respectively, which is equivalent to reducing the cost of solar electricity by about 40%. India and other countries may further expand these policies for accelerating and optimizing energy transition.",

Firstly, this paper studies the dynamic evolution and temporal and spatial pattern of China's provincial green technology innovation and carbon intensity. On this basis, the nonlinear spatial Durbin model (SDM) is used to explore the impact of green technology innovation on carbon intensity, and the relevant variables are controlled. The results show that there is a significant spatial agglomeration phenomenon in China's provincial green technology innovation level and carbon intensity. The direct impact of green technological innovation on carbon intensity in local region shows a significant \"inverted-U\" relationship, that is, when the level of green technological innovation is relatively low, green technological innovation will promote carbon emissions, while when the level of green technological innovation reaches a certain level, this promotion relationship will change into inhibition relationship. From the perspective of interregional spillover effect, green technological innovation also has an \u201cinverted-U\u2033 nonlinear impact on carbon emissions in adjacent regions, that is, the impact of green technological innovation on carbon emissions in adjacent regions is also promoted first and then restrained.",

This article exploits variation in peak ground acceleration from the 2015 earthquake in Nepal to investigate the impact of seismic shocks on household energy choices. Results from a difference-in-differences research design show that households exposed to large seismic shocks were 40.83% more likely to use firewood for cooking after the earthquake. This increase in the use of traditional fuel coincided with a decrease in electricity expenditure and a reduction in adoption of gas cylinders for cooking purposes. Unit prices of firewood also decreased significantly in response to seismic shocks, causing households in earthquake-affected districts to rely more on firewood as a source of cooking fuel. Results further illustrate that household consumption in electricity and kerosene for lighting declined in earthquake-affected districts. These findings conclude that large earthquakes induce poor households to use traditional fuel, exacerbating their transition to modern energy sources. Policymakers working on sustainable economic growth need to consider these disaster-induced changes in energy outcomes to ensure a successful implementation of commitments made under the Paris Agreement (COP21).",

Even where access is available, many off-grid communities are only provided with a few hours of service, typically using diesel, which is expensive and polluting. Using a system dynamics model, this paper investigates how a sustainable and durable electricity supply can be provided in off-grid communities in Colombia. The scenarios examined draw on two government funds that have been established to: deliver the infrastructure and provide subsidies for electricity supply. The results demonstrate that a transition from diesel to renewables is not only possible but also economically viable and desirable. The simulations also show that in order to make the best use of limited government funding for electrification, the transition from diesel to renewables should begin as soon as possible and be accompanied by a zero-diesel policy by 2040. Furthermore, the model highlights that electricity systems should be designed to enable gradual growth in demand \u2013 driven by socio-economic development and productive uses. Given the imperative to provide a sustainable and durable electricity supply to off-grid communities, this paper provides insights into how this can be achieved while delivering clear benefits for users, utilities and the government.",

Although load management functions as a distributed energy resource (DER) and can play a critical role in cost-effective deployment of renewable energy toward economy-wide deep decarbonization, there has been little energy transitions research on how electric grid actors initiate and manage DER deployments over time. We use interviews and archival research to compare case studies of electric cooperatives in the United States, tracing how cooperatives deployed more than 600,000 load management devices over 70 years. Using polycentricism as a frame, we find that DER deployments comprise common pool resources that are strategically created and negotiated across scales by different centers of decision-making over time. Our findings rebut the assumption that DER deployments are solely the result of policies or markets, showing that DER deployments are instead polycentric acts of cooperation and competition. DER deployments require diverse intermediaries within and across levels of deployment, from policy to users, over many years. We show that polycentric governance that builds vertical coordination across local and regional actors can support broad, deep, and distributed energy transition.",

With the accelerated adoption of mini-grids and solar home systems, it is becoming increasingly important to understand how their customer bases consume and spend on electricity. Using a novel data set of hourly electricity consumption and electricity expenditures of about 13,000 solar home system customers in Kenya in 2018 and 2,000 mini-grid customers in Tanzania in 2017, we present a relative examination of the electricity consumption behavior and spending patterns among mini-grid and solar home system customers. Our analysis shows that, on average, mini-grid customers spend substantially less on electricity than solar home system customers and make smaller, more frequent payments during the month. We also find that higher monthly spending among mini-grid customers correlates with off-peak consumption and a higher load factor, contrary to the behavior of solar home system customers. Our results suggest the need for policies that encourage the growth of productive uses of energy that are innovative, diverse, and daytime-oriented to ensure sustainable mini-grid operation, as well as policies that establish a larger market for solar home system-compatible electric appliances that incentivize solar home system customers to increase utilization of their systems.",

By establishing a link between the macro (i.e., country level) and micro (i.e., firm level) levels of analysis and by synthesizing across multiple disciplines including institutional economics, political science, cultural research, and institutional theory, we were able to demonstrate that differences across countries in terms of the political system, the education and labor system, the financial system and the cultural system significantly impacted variation in CSP across companies. In this Retrospective, we briefly discuss our original findings and elaborate on future research directions. Given the weak evidence regarding the impact of the financial system in our original study, we specifically focus on discussing recent developments in the financial system and their implications for research. We suggest additional research opportunities inspired by recent articles by scholars of international business that have extended our original article in important ways.",

We briefly depict the organizational differences between multinational enterprises (MNEs) and multinational platforms (MNPs), followed by a closer look at how social responsibility of digital platforms might depart from our conventional understanding derived from MNEs. We then propose the notion of ecosystem social responsibility emphasizing social value co-creation before categorizing the main areas of social issues specific to MNPs. Based on these ideas, we derive several new insights into the social challenges faced by firms governing global platforms versus multidomestic platforms, respectively, as they serve international markets. Lastly, we discuss future research directions and, in particular, the implications for ecosystem sustainability.",

First, we explain how state-owned firms and funds behave differently from private ones because they need to balance governments\u2019 nonbusiness objectives and firms\u2019 business goals. This results in competing predictions on whether government ownership helps or hinders internationalization due to particular nonbusiness objectives. Second, building on the review, we provide suggestions on how to extend research topics and theories of the firm by incorporating these nonbusiness objectives in the internationalization decisions in four areas: home government\u2019s endowments, characteristics, and attitudes; host-country expansion\u2019s support, influence, and impact; home- and host-country relationship conflicts, mediation, and disguising; and management\u2019s orientation, opacity, and arbitrage. Third, we capture how governments may use state-owned multinationals and sovereign wealth funds to nudge host-country governments by introducing the concept of discreet power and the use of four strategies (recognition, values, development, and supremacy) to achieve it. This helps to outline the beginning of a unified approach to how governments use their foreign investments to achieve nonbusiness goals.",

Given the rapid developments in China\u2019s economy and its institutional environment, we ask the question of whether the effects in Mohr et al. (2016) can be observed over a long period of time. We examine the generalizability of their findings (1) by replicating their study with a larger sample from the same data source, and over a longer period (1985\u20132017), and (2) by studying a sample of 803 IJVs from the same population but from another data source (the Annual Census of Chinese Industrial Enterprises) in the 2000\u20132017 period. We find that state equity can benefit IJV survival from favorable regulatory support, but it can also lead to lower survival rates due to unfavorable governmental intervention. Overall, we advocate a two-sided effect of state equity that leads to a curvilinear relationship between state equity and IJV dissolution, where time is an important boundary condition.",

We build upon the general theory of competitive rationality, suggesting a positive relationship between advertising spending and happiness at the country level. We integrate an institutional economics framework into the general theory of competitive rationality to understand country effects. We explore whether institutional environments (i.e., political, regulatory, and social) are associated with happiness and/or moderate the relationship between advertising spending and happiness. We empirically examine these relationships using a 34-country, 9-year unbalanced panel dataset. Our findings indicate that advertising spending at the country level is positively associated with happiness, even when accounting for country-level institutional direct and moderating effects. We discuss our results in comparison to prior findings, highlighting implications for international marketing theory and practice, and setting forth a foundation for debate and research in the field.",

We hypothesize that populist discourse reduces entrepreneurship by creating regime uncertainty concerning the future stability of the institutional environment, resulting in entrepreneurs anticipating higher future transaction costs. Our model highlights two important factors that moderate the relationship. First is the strength of political checks and balances, which we hypothesize weakens the negative relationship between populist discourse and entrepreneurship by providing entrepreneurs with greater confidence that the actions of a populist will be constrained. Second, the political ideology of the leader moderates the relationship between populist discourse and entrepreneurship. The anti-capitalistic rhetoric of left-wing populism will create greater regime uncertainty than right-wing populism, which is often accompanied by rhetoric critical of free trade and foreigners, but also supportive of business interests. The effect of centrist populism, which is often accompanied by a mix of contradictory and often moderate ideas that make it difficult to discern future transaction costs, will have a weaker negative effect on entrepreneurship than either left-wing or right-wing populism. We empirically test our model using a multi-level design and a dataset comprised of more than 780,000 individuals in 33 countries over the period 2002\u20132016. Our analysis largely supports our theory regarding the moderating role of ideology. However, surprisingly, our findings suggest that the negative effect of populism on entrepreneurship is greater in nations with stronger checks and balances.",

Drawing on attachment theory, we study how boundary-spanning commitments to IJVs may help mitigate interpartner opportunism and facilitate effective knowledge transfer to parents. Specifically, we argue that knowledge transfer from IJVs to their parents is positively mediated by both boundary spanners\u2019 organizational commitment to IJVs and parent firms\u2019 resource commitment to IJVs. We test our arguments using survey data collected from 600 dyadic Chinese\u2013foreign managers of 100 IJVs established in China. The results provide evidence that knowledge sharing between boundary spanners in IJVs positively affects their organizational commitment to these IJVs, which in turn positively affects knowledge transfer to parents. Similarly, knowledge sharing between such boundary spanners positively affects parent firms\u2019 resource commitment to IJVs, which in turn positively affects knowledge transfer to parents. The mediating role of boundary spanners\u2019 organizational commitment is stronger than that of parent firms\u2019 resource commitment. Collectively, our findings suggest that commitment-based relational mechanisms are imperative for safeguarding effective knowledge transfer from IJVs to parent firms.",

We argue that the relative characteristics of firms\u2019 and their partners\u2019 diversification profiles is an indicator of parties\u2019 resource bases and thereby can explain if and when inter-organizational ties yield optimum performance outcomes. We examine these relative characteristics and propose a conceptual refinement by differentiating between the degree and content dimensions of international diversification.
